        "Announcement of the governor of the Warsaw District Ludwig Fischer on November 10, 1941 threatening the death penalty for helping Jews. German retribution against Poles who helped Jews were repressive measures taken by the German occupation authorities against non-Jewish Polish citizens who helped Jews persecuted by Nazi Germany during the Holocaust in Poland, 1939 to 1945. The orders of the occupation authorities, and in particular the ordinance of the general governor Hans Frank of October 15, 1941, provided for the death penalty for every Pole who would provide shelter for a Jew or help him in any other way. In practice, the range of penalties applied to those helping Jews was wide, including fines, confiscation of property, beatings, imprisonment, deportation to Nazi concentration camps and the death penalty. Due to the principle of collective responsibility applied by the Germans, families of those who helped Jews and sometimes entire local communities were subjects to retribution. The exact number of Poles executed by the Germans for helping Jews has not yet been precisely determined. The most cautious estimates give the number of around a few hundred people executed, and the high-end estimates, several thousand.",

Krakow was soon occupied by the German forces, and the racist and anti-Semitic Nuremberg Laws made the Polanskis targets of persecution, forcing them into the Krakow Ghetto, along with thousands of the city's Jews. Around the age of six, he attended primary school for only a few weeks, until \"all the Jewish children were abruptly expelled,\" writes biographer Christopher Sandford. That initiative was soon followed by the requirement that all Jewish children over the age of twelve wear white armbands with a blue Star of David imprinted for visual identification. After he was expelled, he would not be allowed to enter another classroom for the next six years.:18 Polanski then witnessed both the ghettoization of Krakow's Jews into a compact area of the city, and the subsequent deportation of all the ghetto's Jews to German death camps.

Polish property was confiscated, and Chorzow  was promptly re-incorporated into German Silesia ; the Upper Silesian industry being one the pillars of the Nazi Germany war effort. There were several enforced labor camps in Chorzow and, in years 1944\u20131945, two branches of the Auschwitz concentration camp.

        "Bombing of Rotterdam See also: Battle of Rotterdam and Rotterdam Blitz Fighting in Rotterdam had taken place since the first day of the campaign, when German infantrymen in seaplanes landed on the Maas River and captured several bridges intact. The Germans hesitated to risk a tank attack on the city, fearing heavy casualties. Instead, the German commander presented an ultimatum to the Dutch commander in the city. He demanded the surrender of the Dutch garrison and threatened to destroy the city by aerial bombing if they did not accept. The ultimatum was returned on a technicality, since it had not been signed by the German commander. While the corrected ultimatum was being resubmitted, Luftwaffe bombers  struck the city. During the so-called \"Rotterdam Blitz\", between 800 and 900 Dutch civilians were killed, and 25,000 homes were destroyed. The bombers' targets were the civilian areas of Rotterdam, rather than the town's defenses. Under pressure from local officials, the garrison commander surrendered the city and his 10,000 men on the evening of the 14th, with the permission of Henri Winkelman, the Dutch commander-in-chief. This opened up the German advance into \"Fortress Holland\".",

        "Ilmari Juutilainen, a Finnish fighter pilot with Brewster BW-364 \"Orange 4\" on 26 June 1942 during the Continuation War In the later stages on the Eastern Front, Soviet training and leadership improved, as did their equipment. Since 1942 Soviet designs such as the Yakovlev Yak-9 and Lavochkin La-5 had performance comparable to the German Bf 109 and Focke-Wulf Fw 190. Also, significant numbers of British, and later U.S., fighter aircraft were supplied to aid the Soviet war effort as part of Lend-Lease, with the Bell P-39 Airacobra proving particularly effective in the lower-altitude combat typical of the Eastern Front. The Soviets were also helped indirectly by the American and British bombing campaigns, which forced the Luftwaffe to shift many of its fighters away from the Eastern Front in defense against these raids.  The Soviets increasingly were able to challenge the Luftwaffe, and while the Luftwaffe maintained a qualitative edge over the Red Air Force for much of the war, the increasing numbers and efficacy of the Soviet Air Force were critical to the Red Army's efforts at turning back and eventually annihilating the Wehrmacht.",

Prior to Demjanjuk's trial, the requirement that prosecutors find a specific act of murder to charge guards with had resulted in a very low conviction rate for death camp guards. Following Demjanjuk's conviction, however, Germany began aggressively prosecuting former death camp guards. In 2015, former Auschwitz guard Oskar Groning was convicted on the same legal argument as Demjanjuk; his conviction was upheld on appeal, solidifying the precedent made by the Demjanjuk case. In 2019, German prosecutors charged guards at a concentration camp - as opposed to a death camp - on the same rationale for the first time: former Stutthof concentration camp guards Johann Rehbogen and Bruno Dey.",

        "Military situation See also: Bandit fighting and Czech resistance Although there was wide popular support for the resistance, in other ways the Protectorate was ill-suited to partisan activity. There were very few guns, despite the relatively liberal firearms policies in place prior to the occupation. The Protectorate was highly urbanized, which made the establishment of partisan field camps in woods or mountains impractical, and the excellent transport and communications infrastructure was at the disposal of the Nazi security apparatus. Also, the ethnic German minority tended to cooperate with the occupiers and some local Germans joined the security forces, which benefited from their fluency in Czech and knowledge of the local geography.",

May 1940 to June 1941: An economic boom caused by orders from Germany, combined with the \"velvet glove\" approach from Arthur Seyss-Inquart, resulted in a comparatively mild occupation. June 1941 to June 1944: As the war intensified, Germany demanded higher contributions from occupied territories, resulting in a decline of living standards. Repression against the Jewish population intensified and thousands were deported to extermination camps. The \"velvet glove\" approach ended. June 1944 to May 1945: Conditions deteriorated further, leading to starvation and lack of fuel. The German occupation authorities gradually lost control over the situation. Fanatical Nazis wanted to make a last stand and commit acts of destruction. Others tried to mitigate the situation. Most of the south of the country was liberated in the second half of 1944. The rest, especially the west and north of the country still under occupation, suffered from a famine at the end of 1944, known as the \"Hunger Winter\". On 5 May 1945, the whole country was finally liberated by the total surrender of all German forces.",

        "Sinti and other Romani about to be deported from Germany, 22 May 1940 World War II Main article: Porajmos During World War II, the Nazis embarked on a systematic genocide of the Romani, a process known in Romani as the Porajmos. Romanies were marked for extermination and sentenced to forced labor and imprisonment in concentration camps. They were often killed on sight, especially by the Einsatzgruppen  on the Eastern Front. The total number of victims has been variously estimated at between 220,000 and 1,500,000. The treatment of the Romani in Nazi puppet states differed markedly. In the Independent State of Croatia, the Usta\u0161a killed almost the entire Roma population of 25,000. The concentration camp system of Jasenovac, run by the Usta\u0161a militia and the Croat political police, were responsible for the deaths of between 15,000 and 20,000 Roma.",

The United States government was planning to move the school, when the sudden outbreak of hostilities forced a quick departure. Almost immediately the three upper classes were detached and ordered to sea, and the remaining elements of the academy were transported to Fort Adams in Newport, Rhode Island by the USS Constitution in April 1861, where the academy was set up in temporary facilities and opened in May. The Annapolis campus, meanwhile, was turned into a United States Army Hospital.",

The Sarajevo Haggadah was the most important artifact which survived this period, smuggled out of Sarajevo and saved from the Nazis and Usta\u0161e by the chief librarian of the National Museum, Dervi\u0161 Korkut.

Approximately 3,000 Jews were moved to Tenja in June and July 1942. From Tenja, 200 Jews were transported to the Jasenovac concentration camp and 2,800 Jews were transported to the Auschwitz concentration camp.

        "Swedish Holocaust plans It was discovered some years after WWII, when incomplete lists from the SSS/NSAP containing the names of nearly one thousand Jews was found, that the party had hoped for, and planned well for, a Nazi German invasion of Sweden. Local party branches had helped gather well-documented information about hundreds of local Jews' businesses, names, families, their childrens' schools, workplaces, etc, and collected these documents to the party's main branch. These lists are today often referred to as death lists by historians and experts, since the movement was known for their fanatic hatred of Jews. The party would, in case of such an invasion, first have strived to set up a \"Swedish Quisling puppet regime\"  with Lindholm as leader. It has been revealed their plans involved the construction of at least two Swedish concentration camps  for Jews; they had the locations and maps for these ready, and then would have rounded up the thousands of Jews in Sweden along with political opponents and so on, for deportations to the camps and/or to Nazi German death camps.",

The staff dispersed \u2013 a part remained in Orlowa, the rest, being afraid of possible Nazi repressive measures, left the region. The predictions of the oppressive Nazi Germany regime proved true. Most of the teachers were soon arrested and taken away to numerous concentration camps, including school principal Piotr Feliks. The pupils had to give up their secondary studies, the children up to the age of 14 were made to attend German schools, the older ones worked in mines and factories, some were sent to forced labour to Germany. The school building was used as a German miners\u00b4 school, then as a teachers\u00b4 school and finally a military hospital as well as army barracks at the very end of World War II.",

Lieutenant General Erich von Manstein dissented from the 1939 versions of Fall Gelb , a plan for an invasion of France and the Low Countries, devised by Franz Halder. The original Aufmarschanweisung N\u00b01, Fall Gelb , was a plan to push the Allied forces back through central Belgium to the Somme river, in northern France, with similarities to the 1914 campaign of the First World War. On 10 January 1940, a German aircraft carrying documents with parts of the plan for Fall Gelb crashed in Belgium  prompting another review of the invasion plan. Halder revised Fall Gelb to an extent in Aufmarschanweisung N\u00b03, Fall Gelb and Manstein was able to convince Hitler in a meeting on 17 February, that the Wehrmacht should attack through the Ardennes, followed by an advance to the coast.",

Under Nazi rule, the Polish and Jewish minorities were classified as Untermensch and persecuted by the authorities. The city's Jewish population shrank from 3,200 in 1933 to 2,100 in October 1938. The New Synagogue of Konigsberg, constructed in 1896, was destroyed during Kristallnacht ; 500 Jews soon fled the city. After the Wannsee Conference of 20 January 1942, Konigsberg's Jews began to be deported to various Nazi concentration camps: The SS sent the first and largest group of Jewish deportees, comprising 465 Jewish men, women and children, from Konigsberg and East Prussia to the Maly Trostenets extermination camp near Minsk on 24 June 1942. Almost all were murdered soon after their arrival. Additional transports from Konigsberg to the Theresienstadt ghetto and Auschwitz took place until 1945.",

        "History The church plans were established in an architectural competition in April 1854. 75 projects from the Austrian Empire, German lands, England, and France were submitted. Originally, the plans were to include the neighbouring Allgemeines Krankenhaus and create a campus fashioned after the plans of Oxford and Cambridge University. Another plan was to create a national cathedral for all the people of the empire. However, because of spiraling costs and the changing political situation, this plan had to be downsized. The jury choose the project of Heinrich von Ferstel , who, at the time, was only 26. He chose to build the cathedral in the neo-Gothic style, borrowing heavily from the architecture of Gothic French cathedrals. Because of this concept, many people mistake this church for an original Gothic church. However, the Votivkirche is not a servile imitation of a French Gothic cathedral, but rather embodies a new and individual design concept. Furthermore, the Votivkirche was built with one single architect exercising supervision over its entire construction, and not by several generations, as were the cathedrals in the Middle Ages.",

        "Operation Details about the operation of Lichtenburg, held by the International Tracing Service, only became available to researchers in late 2006. An account of the way the camp was run may be read in Lina Haag's book A Handful of Dust or How Long the Night. Haag was perhaps the best known survivor of Lichtenburg, having obtained release before it was shut down. Lichtenburg was among the first concentration camps in Nazi Germany operating from 13 June 1933, it became a kind of model for numerous subsequent establishments. Soon overcrowded, the detention conditions increasingly aggravated. Most of the inmates were political prisoners, and so-called habitual offenders . From 1937 on it became a camp only for women. In 1939 the SS transferred 900 Lichtenburg prisoners to Ravensbruck, which were its first female prisoners. The castle today houses a regional museum and exhibit about Lichtenburg's use during the Nazi period.",

In 1486 it was occupied by the forces of the Old Swiss Confederacy on a campaign into the Landgraviate of Klettgau. The immediate landgraviate was inherited by the House of Schwarzenberg in 1687 with their residence in Tiengen, and elevated to a principality by Emperor Leopold I in 1694. After the Schwarzenberg landgraviate was mediatised in 1806, the lordship fell to the Grand Duchy of Baden in 1812. The present-day municipality was established in a 1971 administrative reform. Buhl and Geisslingen were incorporated in 1975.",

It was created while Rosenthal was a prisoner at the Gurs internment camp in France during World War II. The comic features Walt Disney's Mickey Mouse, who is arrested on suspicion of being Jewish and is sent to Gurs. Rosenthal acknowledged the source of his protagonist by adding \"Publie Sans Autorisation de Walt Disney\"  to the front cover. Rosenthal was detained in Gurs for two years before being sent to Auschwitz in September 1942; he was murdered on the day of his arrival. Mickey au Camp de Gurs was first published in 2014 in Paris by Calmann-Levy and the Memorial de la Shoah, 72\u00a0years after it was written. Mickey au Camp de Gurs has been called \"one of the earliest surviving examples of a comic from the Holocaust\", and \"perhaps the earliest sequential art narrative dealing with the Holocaust\".",

        "Retrieved from \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_Albert_Altenkirch\"The Spath  family created one of the world's most notable plant nurseries of the 19th and early 20th centuries. The nursery had been founded in 1720 by Christoph Spath but removed to the erstwhile district of Baumschulenweg  in south-east Berlin in 1863 when Franz Ludwig Spath  succeeded his father Ludwig as manager when aged only 25. By the end of the 19th century, the nursery was the largest in the world, occupying 120 hectares.  In 1874 Franz built a mansion on the site, now part of Humboldt University and, five years later, established an arboretum.  After his death in Britz in 1913, Franz Spath was succeeded by his son, Hellmut, who revived the nursery's flagging fortunes during the Depression by joining the Nazi Party and securing lucrative landscaping contracts for the new autobahns and other public works. However, his outspoken criticism of the Nazi regime saw him incarcerated in Sachsenhausen concentration camp where he was executed in 1945. The nursery had closed the year before, and in 1947 the arboretum passed into public ownership becoming known as the Spathsches Arboretum.",

He said to his staff before dissolving his command: \"Has everything been done to justify our actions in the light of history? What can there be left for a commander in defeat? In antiquity they took poison\". His decision to commit suicide was sealed when he learned that the Soviets had indicted him for war crimes, specifically the deaths of 577,000 people in concentration camps in Latvia and the deportation of 175,000 others as slave labor. These acts were committed by the SS and there is no evidence he was aware of them. He shot himself in the head in a forest on 21 April 1945. The site of the event, between Duisburg and the village of Lintorf, is today part of the city of Ratingen. Model was buried by his men where he died. In 1955, his son, Hansgeorg Model had Model's remains recovered from its field grave and organized a reburial in the Soldatenfriedhof Vossenack, a German military cemetery in the Hurtgen Forest.",

With the impending German invasion of Poland planned for September 1939, the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht  requested the assistance of Slovakia. Although the Slovak military was only six months old, it formed a small mobile combat group consisting of a number of infantry and artillery battalions. Two combat groups were created for the campaign in Poland for use alongside the Germans. The first group was a brigade-sized formation that consisted of six infantry battalions, two artillery battalions, and a company of combat engineers, all commanded by Antonin Pulanich. The second group was a mobile formation that consisted of two battalions of combined cavalry and motorcycle recon troops along with nine motorised artillery batteries, all commanded by Gustav Malar. The two groups reported to the headquarters of the 1st and 3rd Slovak Infantry Divisions. The two combat groups fought while pushing through the Nowy Sacz and Dukla Mountain Passes, advancing towards Debica and Tarnow in the region of southern Poland.",

The extermination of people targeted in the \"Final Solution\" was dependent on two factors: the capacity of the death camps to gas the victims and quickly dispose of their bodies, as well as the capacity of the railways to transport the victims from Nazi ghettos to extermination camps. The most modern accurate numbers on the scale of the \"Final Solution\" still rely partly on shipping records of the German railways.",

        "Geneva Conference The International Committee of the Red Cross held a conference in Geneva, Switzerland in September 1917. The conference addressed the war, and the Red Cross addressed the conditions that the civilians were living under, which resembled those of soldiers in prisoner of war camps, as well as \"barbed wire disease\"  suffered by prisoners in France and Germany. It was agreed at the conference that the Red Cross would provide prisoners of war with mail, food parcels, clothes, and medical supplies and that prisoners in France and Germany suffering from \"barbed wire disease\" should be interned in Switzerland, a neutral country. A few countries were not on the same terms as Germany and Austria. For example, Hungary believed that harsh conditions would reduce the number of traitors. The countries in the east continued their fight to help the Red Cross provide support to POWs. At the end of the war, a Franco-German agreement was made that both countries would exchange their prisoners, but the French kept a small number while the Germans released all French prisoners.",

The director of the series, Hassan Fathi, said about it, \"I decided to produce this series in 2002, and in those days the Holocaust was not an issue. Even if one single Jew is killed in German camps, the world should be ashamed. By the same token, if a single Palestinian dies, the world should be ashamed. I sympathize with the Jewish victims of World War II, to the same extent with women and children victims of the war in Palestine.\" The TV series won the praise and support of Iran's Jewish Association, an independent body that safeguards the community's culture and heritage.

With the help of the Ministry of Social Affairs, including Kamilo Bresler, she was able to relocate child inmates from the camp to Zagreb, and other places. The Red Cross has been accused of insufficiently aiding the persecuted people of Nazi Europe. The local representative, Julius Schmidllin, was contacted by the Jewish community, which sought financial aid. The organisation helped to release Jews from camps, and even debated with the Croatian government in relation to visiting the Jasenovac camp. The wish was eventually granted in July 1944. The camp was prepared for the arrival of the delegation, so nothing incriminating was found. Inmate resistance groups were aided by contacts among the Usta\u0161e. One of these groups, operating in the tannery, was assisted by an Usta\u0161e, Dr Marin Jurcev , who were later hanged for this on orders of Dinko \u0160akic, as was any Ustasha found guilty of consorting or collaborating with inmates were executed.",

        "Flight, arrest and death  Plaque on Arthuys's home in Avenue Victor-Hugo, Paris A son of Colonel Heurtaux was arrested in February 1941. Heurtaux intervened at Vichy and at the German military headquarters in Paris to get his son released. Instead, he was also arrested. For some time Arthuys and Lefaurichon went into hiding in the provinces. They returned to Paris, and on 21 December 1941 both men were arrested at Lefaurichon's home. After Arthuys was arrested by the Gestapo, leadership of the OCM was assumed by Colonel Alfred Touny. It continued to provide intelligence to the Free French leaders in exile in Britain. Arthuys was deported to Hinzert concentration camp, where he died on 9 September 1943. On 13 July 1945 Arthuys was given the retroactive rank of Colonel, effective 1 December 1, 1941.",

Although initially the camps of Gusen and Mauthausen mostly served the local quarries, from 1942 onwards they began to be included in the German war machine. To accommodate the ever-growing number of slave workers, additional subcamps  of Mauthausen were built.  By the end of the war, the list included 101 camps  which covered most of modern Austria, from Mittersill south of Salzburg to Schwechat east of Vienna and from Passau on the prewar Austro-German border to the Loibl Pass on the border with Yugoslavia. The subcamps were divided into several categories, depending on their main function: Produktionslager for factory workers, Baulager for construction, Aufraumlager for cleaning the rubble in Allied-bombed towns, and Kleinlager  where the inmates were working specifically for the SS.",

The town's name means \"confluence\" in old German; the prefix Hannoversch, or \"Hanoverian\", was added in the 19th century to help distinguish the town from its similarly-named Prussian neighbour, Minden.   City rights might have been granted during the latter half of the 12th century. The French inventor Denis Papin built a steam-pump-powered paddlewheel boat, probably pedal-driven in 1704, and as a demonstration used it to navigate down the Fulda River from Kassel to Munden in 1707. Hann. Munden was the site of the Royal Prussian Academy of Forestry: the city's botanical gardens with many different trees were primarily established for this academy. Later the academy was merged into the University of Gottingen, moving to a new building on the main campus in 1970.",

        "A drawing of Australian POWs being marched through Germany during the winter of 1944-45 \"The March\" refers to a series of forced marches during the final stages of the Second World War in Europe. From a total of 257,000 western Allied prisoners of war held in German military prison camps, over 80,000 POWs were forced to march westward across Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Germany in extreme winter conditions, over about four months between January and April 1945. This series of events has been called various names: \"The Great March West\", \"The Long March\", \"The Long Walk\", \"The Long Trek\", \"The Black March\", \"The Bread March\", and \"Death March Across Germany\", but most survivors just called it \"The March\". As the Soviet Army was advancing on the Eastern front, German authorities decided to evacuate POW camps, to delay liberation of the prisoners. At the same time, hundreds of thousands of German civilian refugees, most of them women and children, as well as civilians of other nationalities, were also making their way westward on foot.:40\u201342 Notorious examples include:",

They were given serial numbers 31 to 758. In a letter on 12 July 1940, Hoss told Glucks that the local population was \"fanatically Polish, ready to undertake any sort of operation against the hated SS men\". By the end of 1940, the SS had confiscated land around the camp to create a 40-square-kilometer  \"zone of interest\"  patrolled by the SS, Gestapo and local police. By March 1941, 10,900 were imprisoned in the camp, most of them Poles. An inmate's first encounter with Auschwitz, if they were registered and not sent straight to the gas chamber, was at the prisoner reception center near the gate with the Arbeit macht frei sign, where they were tattooed, shaved, disinfected, and given a striped prison uniform. Built between 1942 and 1944, the center contained a bathhouse, laundry, and 19 gas chambers for delousing clothes. The prisoner reception center of Auschwitz I became the visitor reception center of the Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum.",

The first part of Night and Fog shows remnants of Auschwitz while the narrator Michel Bouquet describes the rise of Nazi ideology. The film continues with comparisons of the life of the Schutzstaffel to the starving prisoners in the camps. Bouquet then shows the sadism inflicted upon the doomed inmates, including scientific and medical experiments, executions, and rape. The next section is shown completely in black-and-white, and depicts images of gas chambers and piles of bodies.

Poland was where the German program of extermination of Jews, the \"Final Solution\", was implemented, since this was where most of Europe's Jews    lived. In 1939 several hundred synagogues were blown up or burned by the Germans, who sometimes forced the Jews to do it themselves. In many cases, the Germans turned the synagogues into factories, places of entertainment, swimming pools, or prisons. By war's end, almost all the synagogues in Poland had been destroyed. Rabbis were forced to dance and sing in public with their beards shorn off. Some rabbis were set on fire or hanged.",

Sobibor was one of four extermination camps established as part of Operation Reinhard, the deadliest phase of the Holocaust. The extermination of Europe's Jews did not originate as a single top-down decision, but was rather a patchwork of decisions made regarding particular occupied areas. Following the invasion of Poland in September 1939, the Germans began implementing the Nisko Plan in which Jews were deported from ghettos across Europe to the forced labor camps which comprised the Lublin Reservation. Lublin District region was chosen in particular for its inhospitable conditions. The Nisko Plan was abandoned in 1940, but many forced labor camps continued operations in the area, including Trawniki, Lipowa 7, and Dorohucza.",

Several scenes of atrocities conducted by Germany were duly updated with commemorative plaques clearly indicating the nationality of the perpetrators. The IPN also requested better documentation and commemoration of crimes that had been perpetrated by the Soviet Union. The Polish government also asked UNESCO to officially change the name \"Auschwitz Concentration Camp\" to \"Former Nazi German Concentration Camp Auschwitz-Birkenau\", to clarify that the camp had been built and operated by Nazi Germany. At its 28 June 2007 meeting in Christchurch, New Zealand, UNESCO's World Heritage Committee changed the camp's name to \"Auschwitz Birkenau German Nazi Concentration and Extermination Camp .\" Previously some German media, including Der Spiegel, had called the camp \"Polish\".",

A wide street, which led to a large open area, was flanked by two rows of wooden barracks, on both sides stood rows of young trees and along the roadside ran straight flower beds as far as the eye could see. The square and the streets seemed freshly raked. To the left towards the watchtower, I saw a white wooden barrack and beside it a large cage, the size of a birdhouse the like you see at a zoo. Within it paraded peacocks  and on a climbing tree dangled monkeys and a parrot which always screamed the same word, \"Mama\". I wondered, \"this is  a concentration camp\"?

        "Early war-time ID issued to Paul Blobel by the \"Volkswohlfahrt\", Nazi Germany's welfare organization. SS career  Blobel in SS uniform In 1933 Blobel joined the police force in Dusseldorf. In June 1934 he was recruited into the SD Security Service. During World War II, following Operation Barbarossa, in June 1941 Blobel became the commanding officer of Sonderkommando 4a of Einsatzgruppe C, active in Reichskommissariat Ukraine. Both, Einsatzgruppen and the Order Police battalions were responsible for massacres of Jews behind the Wehrmacht lines in the Soviet Union. The murder campaign included all political and racial undesirables. In August 1941 Blobel was put in charge of creating a Nazi ghetto in Zhytomyr to enclose around 3,000 Jews who were murdered a month later. On 10 or 11 August 1941, Friedrich Jeckeln ordered him, on behalf of Adolf Hitler, to exterminate the entire Jewish population. On 22 August 1941, the Sonderkommando murdered Jewish women and children at Bila Tserkva with the consent of Field Marshal Walther von Reichenau, commander of the 6th Army.

        "War crimes against Serbs, Jews and Roma The region was ruled by the German army. The Germans instituted anti-Jewish measures immediately after the German invasion and occupation of Yugoslavia. The Jewish population of the city of Zrenjanin was rounded up and sent to the Ta\u0161majdan concentration camp near Belgrade where they were executed. In September 1941, there was a mass hanging of Serb and Jewish civilians. Jews were also forced into labor battalions to do forced work for the German occupation authorities. In August 1942, German officials announced that the area was judenrein, i.e. \"clean of Jews\". Between 1941 and 1944, at a Strati\u0161te locality near Jabuka village in Banat, more than 10,000 Serbs, Jews and Roma were killed by German forces.",

These included 1,900 German convicts from the SS military camp at Danzig-Matzkau. Nevertheless extremely high casualties were inflicted on Dirlewanger during fighting in Warsaw by the Polish resistance. During the course of the two-month urban warfare Dirlewanger lost 2,733 men. Thus, total casualties numbered 315% of the unit's initial strength. While some of the regiment's actions were criticized by Erich von dem Bach-Zelewski  and the sector commander, Generalmajor Gunter Rohr, Dirlewanger was recommended for the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross by Reinefarth and promotion to SS-Oberfuhrer der Reserve. By 3 October 1944, the remaining Polish insurgents had surrendered and the depleted regiment spent the next month guarding the line along the Vistula. During this time, the regiment was upgraded to brigade status, and named SS-Sonderbrigade Dirlewanger . In early October, it was decided to upgrade the Dirlewanger again, this time to a Waffen-SS combat brigade. Accordingly, it was redesignated 2. SS-Sturmbrigade Dirlewanger in December 1944, and had soon reached its complement of 4,000 men.",

        "Politics Smith met Governor Huey P. Long in 1929 and became his national organizer during the Great Depression, when Long launched the Share Our Wealth society. This movement proposed minimum and maximum limits on household wealth and income. Smith resigned his ministry to work full-time recruiting members to the society. In describing his campaign philosophy, Smith wrote that \"in order to succeed, a mass movement must be superficial for quick appeal, fundamental for permanence, dogmatic for certainty, and practical for workability.\" After Long was assassinated in 1935, Smith directed the society for a short time. He became an ally of Francis Townsend, Father Charles Coughlin and Huey Long's followers in forming the Union Party. It nominated William Lemke as its presidential candidate in the 1936 election. In the fall of 1936, Smith joined the former short-term Governor James A. Noe in a tour of Louisiana in which the two railed against Governor Richard Leche's sales tax on luxury items, revenue that the governor claimed was essential for the state's share of the new Social Security program. Noe charged that Leche \"sold out to Roosevelt to finance Social Security.",

On the nights of 13\u201315 February 1945, some 1,200 British and US bombers attacked the German city of Dresden, which was crowded with wounded and refugees from the Eastern Front. The attacks were part of an area bombing campaign that was initiated by Churchill in January with the intention of shortening the war. Churchill came to regret the bombing because initial reports suggested an excessive number of civilian casualties close to the end of the war, though an independent commission in 2010 confirmed a death toll between 22,700 and 25,000. On 28 March, he decided to restrict area bombing and sent a memorandum to General Ismay for the Chiefs of Staff Committee:",

        "Italy  The nearest Italy came to returning to fascism was the 1970 Golpe Borghese of commando veteran Junio Valerio Borghese. Following the last stand of Italian fascism with the German-supported Italian Social Republic towards the end of the Second World War, those elements within Italian society which remained loyal to the legacy of Benito Mussolini and fascism , rejecting both the Catholic and Communist alternatives prominent in mainstream Italian politics, founded the Italian Social Movement in 1946 under Giorgio Almirante. The MSI was regarded as the successor of the National Fascist Party and the Republican Fascist Party. The motto of the party was \"not repudiate, not restore\", indicating a more moderate parliamentary democratic neo-fascism, which did not heap scorn on the recent past. Italian society did not undergo a process as extensive as the post-war Denazification campaign in occupied Germany, partly due to the Cold War and the Western Allies not wanting Italy to move towards the Warsaw Pact .",

He was shot down by two Messerschmitt Bf 109s from Jagdgruppe Losigkeit, flown by Leutnants Heinz Knoke and Dieter Gerhard.  Gunn bailed out before his Spitfire crashed near Langurda, Surnadal, Norway, and was made a prisoner of war. Gunn was initially suspected by the Germans of having flown from a covert RAF base in somewhere in northern Norway. He was questioned over a period of three weeks before being processed into the prison camp system.   Gunn was sent to Stalag Luft III in the German province of Lower Silesia near the town of Sagan , where he became a regular member of the tunnelling team.

        "The group led by Wiedenhofen Since the 1930s a group of dissents had met in Gerresheim, one of Dusseldorf's 43 boroughs.  Among them were Aloys Odenthal\u00a0, an architect,  and Theodor Winkens a baker and pastry chef, but who had been a clerk at police headquarters, and the lawyer Karl Muller. Odenthal had firm Christian convictions. He had been interrogated twice by the Gestapo for his dissident statements, who threatened him with detention in a concentration camp. Winkens had been sacked as a clerk at the police headquarters in 1938 because he refused to divorce his wife, a Jew.  Another group of opponents of Nazism was led by the lawyer Karl August Wiedenhofen. The Wiedenhofen group included the engineer and businessman Josef Knab and master craftsman Ernst Klein, Josef Lauxtermann and Karl Kleppe. In the summer of 1944 Otto Goetsch joined the Wiedenhofen group.  Although Goetsch was a high official and member of the NSDAP, he was opposed to Nazism. In 1943 the two groups began to meet  twice a month to plan.  Their common goal was the liberation of Germany from Nazism. No actions, however were actually carried out.",

The mass killing facilities were developed at about the same time inside the Auschwitz II-Birkenau subcamp of a forced labour complex, and at the Majdanek concentration camp. In most other camps prisoners were selected for slave labor first; they were kept alive on starvation rations and made available to work as required. Auschwitz, Majdanek, and Jasenovac were retrofitted with Zyklon-B gas chambers and crematoria buildings as the time went on, remaining operational until war's end in 1945.",

        "Judaism Lviv historically had a large and active Jewish community and until 1941 at least 45 synagogues and prayer houses existed. Even in the 16th century, two separate communities existed. One lived in today's old town with the other in the Krakowskie Przedmiescie. The Golden Rose Synagogue was built in Lviv in 1582. In the 19th century, a more differentiated community started to spread out. Liberal Jews sought more cultural assimilation and spoke German and Polish. On the other hand, Orthodox and Hasidic Jews tried to retain the old traditions. Between 1941 and 1944, the Germans in effect completely destroyed the centuries-old Jewish tradition of Lviv. Most synagogues were destroyed and the Jewish population forced first into a ghetto before being forcibly transported to concentration camps where they were murdered. Under the Soviet Union, synagogues remained closed and were used as warehouses or cinemas. Only since the fall of the Iron Curtain, has the remainder of the Jewish community experienced a faint revival. Currently, the only functioning Orthodox Jewish synagogue in Lviv is the Beis Aharon V'Yisrael Synagogue.",

Woods was the cellist in the second American performance of Vitkor Ullmann's Third String Quartet, which he studied with Henry Meyer, longtime second violinist of the LaSalle String Quartet and himself a concentration camp survivor. Inspired by Meyer's teaching and experiences, Woods has made recording and performing of music of this generation of composers a central focus of his musical life.

A memorial museum was opened on the former campgrounds in 1967. The set up was prepared by the curator historians Ivana Gruden Miletinjevic and Neboj\u0161a Ozimic. In 1979, the campgrounds were declared a Cultural Monument of Exceptional Importance and came under the protection of the Socialist Republic of Serbia. A film detailing the events at the camp titled Lager Ni\u0161 was released in Yugoslavia in 1987.

        "Liquidation  Deportation to a death camp during liquidation of the Biala Podlaska Ghetto conducted by the Reserve Police Battalion 101 in 1942 In 1942, the Nazis began Operation Reinhard, the systematic deportation of Jews to extermination camps. Nazi authorities throughout Europe deported Jews to ghettos in Eastern Europe or most often directly to extermination camps built by Nazi Germany in occupied Poland. Almost 300,000 people were deported from the Warsaw Ghetto alone to Treblinka over the course of 52 days. In some ghettos, local resistance organizations staged ghetto uprisings. None were successful, and the Jewish populations of the ghettos were almost entirely killed. On June 21, 1943, Heinrich Himmler issued an order to liquidate all ghettos and transfer remaining Jewish inhabitants to concentration camps. A few ghettos were re-designated as concentration camps and existed until 1944.",

The policy was first articulated by General Benjamin F. Butler in 1861, in what came to be known as the \"Fort Monroe Doctrine,\" established in Hampton, Virginia. By war's end, the Union had set up 100 contraband camps in the South, and the Roanoke Island Freedmen's Colony  was developed to be a self-sustaining colony. Many adult freedmen worked for wages for the Army at such camps, teachers were recruited from the North for their schools by the American Missionary Association, and thousands of freedmen enlisted from such camps in the United States Colored Troops to fight with the Union against the Confederacy.",

Every year, ARSP sends approximately 180 volunteers to countries that suffered under the German occupation during World War II: Belgium, France, the United Kingdom, Netherlands, Russia, Poland, Czech Republic, Belarus, and the Ukraine.

It was first published in 1973, and translated into English, and French, the following year. It covers life in what is often known as the Gulag, the Soviet forced labour camp system, through a narrative constructed from various sources including reports, interviews, statements, diaries, legal documents, and Solzhenitsyn's own experience as a Gulag prisoner. In Russian, the term GULAG  is an acronym for Main Directorate of Camps . Following its publication, the book initially circulated in samizdat underground publication in the Soviet Union until its appearance in the literary journal Novy Mir in 1989, in which a third of the work was published in three issues. Since the dissolution of the Soviet Union, The Gulag Archipelago has been officially published in Russia. An abridged fiftieth anniversary edition was released on 1 November 2018 with a new foreword by Jordan Peterson.",

        "Concentration and extermination camps  March to the gas chambers, one of Sonderkommando photographs taken secretly at Auschwitz II in August 1944 At the camps of Operation Reinhard, including Belzec, Sobibor, and Treblinka, trainloads of prisoners were destined for immediate death in gas chambers designed exclusively for that purpose. The mass killing facilities were developed at about the same time inside the Auschwitz II-Birkenau subcamp of a forced labour complex, and at the Majdanek concentration camp. In most other camps prisoners were selected for slave labor first; they were kept alive on starvation rations and made available to work as required. Auschwitz, Majdanek, and Jasenovac were retrofitted with Zyklon-B gas chambers and crematoria buildings as the time went on, remaining operational until war's end in 1945.",

According to some finvenkists, this \"final victory\" of Esperanto may help eradicate war, chauvinism and cultural oppression.

The deportations came at the request of Germany, which needed the labour; the Slovak government paid the Germans RM\u00a0500 per Jew on the understanding that the government would lay claim to the deportees' property. Around 800 of the 58,000 Slovakian Jews deported between March and October 1942 survived. Vrba blamed the Slovak Jewish Council for having cooperated with the deportations. Insisting that he would not be \"deported like a calf in a wagon\", he decided to join the Czechoslovak Army in exile in England and set off in a taxi for the border, aged 17, with a map, a box of matches, and the equivalent of \u00a310 from his mother. After making his way to Budapest, Hungary, he decided to return to Trnava but was arrested at the Hungarian border.

        "From 1933 to 1945, Nazi Germany operated more than a thousand concentration camps on its own territory and in parts of German-occupied Europe.  The first camps were established in March 1933 immediately after Adolf Hitler became Chancellor of Germany. Following the Night of Long Knives in 1934, the concentration camps were run exclusively by the SS via the Concentration Camps Inspectorate and later the SS Main Economic and Administrative Office. Initially, most prisoners were members of the Communist Party of Germany, but as time went on different groups were arrested, including \"habitual criminals\", \"asocials\", and Jews. After the beginning of World War II, people from German-occupied Europe were imprisoned in the concentration camps. Following Allied military victories, the camps were gradually liberated in 1944 and 1945, although hundreds of thousands of prisoners died in the death marches. More than 1,000 concentration camps  were established during the history of Nazi Germany and around 1.65 million people were registered prisoners in the camps at one point. Around a million died during their imprisonment. Many of the former camps have been turned into museums commemorating the victims of the Nazi regime.",

However, some Czech Jewish children were rescued by Kindertransport and escaped to the United Kingdom and other Allied countries. Some were reunited with their families after the war, while many lost parents and relatives to the concentration camps. It is estimated that of the 118,310 Jews living in the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia upon the German invasion in 1939, 26,000 emigrated legally and illegally; 80,000 were murdered by the Nazis; and 10,000 survived the concentration camps.",

Very few men volunteered, and the Germans decided on forced conscription to fill their ranks. Most of the conscripts subsequently deserted, and the two units were disbanded. Schutzmannschaft Battalion 107 mutinied against its German officers, disarmed them, and joined the Home Army resistance. Some Poles also passed on the side of the Soviet partisans - like Mikolaj Kunicki, Kompaniefuhrer in Schutzmannschaft 104.

Legs, backs and necks full of wounds of a type that an average Swede would be on sick leave for just one of them. I counted twenty on one prisoner, and he did not complain. This first transport collected 550 prisoners while 67 very sick prisoners were left behind. A huge problem during the transports was the prisoners' chronic diarrhoea. This situation was subsequently remedied by the Danes supplying portable toilets of a type that had been used during their transports. Due to the Swedish transports Neuengamme received ever more prisoners, and the concentration of Scandinavian prisoners that Himmler had promised did not materialize. Swedish health personnel and the buses were not allowed to enter the camp as the Germans would not let the Swedes see the camp.  Instead the prisoners had to march to the buses.",

From 1932, Heissmeyer was posted to the SS Main Office, becoming its leader in 1935 and relieving Heinrich Himmler from that specific position. On 9 November 1936, Heissmeyer was promoted to SS-Obergruppenfuhrer  and Inspector of the National Political Institutes of Education. In 1939, Heissmeyer was appointed SS Oberabschnittsleiter \"East\" and in 1940 as HSSPF  Spree, where he was in charge of the Berlin-Brandenburg area.  August Heissmeyer took over the command of the SS Totenkopf Standarte in 1940 from the outgoing Theodor Eicke, who in 1939 had begun commanding a combat SS division  and therefore gave his supervision over the concentration camps back to the SS Leadership Main  Office. Heissmeyer was provisionally in charge of this bureau until May 1942. Richard Glucks took over the position, and became the chief of the Concentration Camps Inspectorate. In April 1945, Heissmeyer was given command of Kampfgruppe \"Heissmeyer\", a collection of Volkssturm militia and Hitler Youth who were given the task of protecting the Spandau airfield outside Berlin.",

By the end of 1940, the SS had confiscated land around the camp to create a 40-square-kilometer  \"zone of interest\"  patrolled by the SS, Gestapo and local police. By March 1941, 10,900 were imprisoned in the camp, most of them Poles.

Built between 1942 and 1944, the center contained a bathhouse, laundry, and 19 gas chambers for delousing clothes.

Thousands of inmates from five subcamps of Stutthof worked on the airfields. Airfields and bases near several other concentration camps and ghettos were constructed or maintained by prisoners. On the orders of the Luftwaffe, prisoners from Buchenwald and Herzogenbusch were forced to defuse bombs that had fallen around Dusseldorf and Leeuwarden respectively. Thousands of Luftwaffe personnel worked as concentration camp guards. Auschwitz included a munitions factory guarded by Luftwaffe soldiers; 2,700 Luftwaffe personnel worked as guards at Buchenwald. Dozens of camps and subcamps were staffed primarily by Luftwaffe soldiers. According to the Encyclopedia of Camps and Ghettos, it was typical for camps devoted to armaments production to be run by the branch of the Wehrmacht that used the products. In 1944, many Luftwaffe soldiers were transferred to concentration camps to alleviate personnel shortages.",

Gassing with Zyklon B was used mainly at Auschwitz and Majdanek with over 1 million victims, and Carbon monoxide at Treblinka, Sobibor, Belzec and Chelmno, the main extermination camps. Such mass murder followed the earlier murders through gunfire by the Einsatzgruppen death squads. Many of the SS staff involved in the later murders developed their lethal methods during the Action T4 programme, overseen by Conti. Victims were deceived in the same way as in Action T4, using very elaborate means to convince them that no harm was intended to them. Conti was also involved in the forensic investigation into the Katyn massacre, and received a detailed report, known as the Katyn Commission on the discovery from an international team of experts.",

        "The Third Reich Wintershall benefited extensively from expropriation in Nazi Germany, the use of forced labourers and concentration camp internees, and from the politically active role of August Rosterg, who ran the company from World War I to the end of World War II. Rosterg maintained close ties with the NSDAP elite and met the commander of the SS, Heinrich Himmler, personally on several occasions. The American military government considered Rosterg, as a member of \u201cHimmler\u2019s circle\u201d, to be a \u201ccaptain of industry under the National Socialist regime\u201d. Under his management, Wintershall was fully integrated in the NS system and acted in accordance with its goals. In the 1930s, Wintershall took over Naphthaindustrie und Tankanlagen AG , renaming it NITAG Deutsche Treibstoffe AG in 1938. NITAG had already been \"Aryanised\" by the time it was taken over, with the Jewish family Kahan no longer holding any shares in the company from 1932 at the latest. As a result, NITAG became the main sales subsidiary for mineral oil products alongside Mihag, Wiesol and Wintershall Mineralol GmbH. Forced labourers were increasingly used during World War II. 1360 internees from the Buchenwald concentration camp had to work at Wintershall's Lutzkendorf plant.",

He would snatch babies from their mothers' arms and tear them to pieces in his hands.  I saw him beat two men to death with a rifle, because they did not carry out his instructions properly, since they did not understand German.  I remember that one night a group of youths aged fifteen or sixteen arrived in the camp.  The head of this group was one Abraham.  After a long and arduous work day, this young man collapsed on his pallet and fell asleep.  Suddenly Wagner came into our barrack, and Abraham did not hear him call to stand up at once before him.  Furious, he pulled Abraham naked off his bed and began to beat him all over his body.  When Wagner grew weary of the blows, he took out his revolver and killed him on the spot.  This atrocious spectacle was carried out before all of us, including Abraham's younger brother. Erich Bauer would later remark:",

It was established in September 1941 on the outskirts of Lwow in Eastern Poland / Western Ukraine . The camp was named after the nearby street Janowska in Lwow of the interwar Second Polish Republic.  The camp was liquidated in November 1943, with the evidence of mass murder being largely destroyed in the Nazi program of Sonderaktion 1005. Estimates put the total number of prisoners who passed through the Janowska camp at between 100,000 and 120,000, mostly Polish and Soviet Jews. The number of victims murdered at the camp is estimated at 35,000\u201340,000.",

        "The three Gusen concentration camps held a significant proportion of prisoners within the Mauthausen-Gusen complex. For most of its history, this exceeded the number of prisoners at the Mauthausen main camp itself. DEST began purchasing land at St Georgen/Gusen in May 1938. During 1938 and 1939, inmates of the nearby Mauthausen makeshift camp marched daily to the granite quarries at St Georgen/Gusen, which were more productive and more important for DEST than the Wienergraben Quarry.  After Germany invaded Poland in September 1939, the as-yet unfinished Mauthausen camp was already overcrowded with prisoners. The numbers of inmates rose from 1,080 in late 1938 to over 3,000 a year later. At about that time, the construction of a new camp \"for the Poles\" began in Gusen about 4.5 kilometres  away. The new camp  became operational in May 1940. The first inmates were put in the first two huts  on 17 April 1940, while the first transport of prisoners\u00a0\u2013 mostly from the camps in Dachau and Sachsenhausen\u00a0\u2013 arrived just over a month later, on 25 May.",

Wulf joined a group of Jewish resistance fighters, but he was captured and imprisoned in the Auschwitz concentration camp. He survived after fleeing, on 18 January 1945, during one of the notorious death marches that took place just before the camp's liberation, when the SS forced inmates to move to different camps. Wulf's wife and son survived the war by hiding with Polish peasants, but he lost his father, mother, brother, mother-in-law, and young niece.",

After these flights the public treated Eckener as a national hero. During the early 1930s, Eckener was one of the most well-known and respected figures in Weimar Republic Germany. In the 1932 presidential election Eckener was a potential unity candidate against Adolf Hitler, encouraged to campaign by leaders of both the SPD and the Zentrum, but he bowed out when Paul von Hindenburg decided to run for a second term. However, his potential candidacy had already angered the Nazi party. In supposed anger and fear of Eckener, Hitler's de facto deputy, Hermann Esser, once called him the \"director of the flying weisswurst\", a greyish-white Bavarian sausage.",

By March 1941, 10,900 were imprisoned there. In September 1941, some 200 ill prisoners, most of them Poles, along with 600 Soviet POWs, were killed in the first gassing experiments at Auschwitz. Beginning in 1942, Auschwitz's prisoner population became much more diverse, as Jews and other \"undesirables\" from all over German-occupied Europe were deported to the camp. About 960,000 Jews died at Auschwitz amongst its 1.1 million victims, including 438,000 Jews from Hungary and 300,000 Polish Jews, 69,000 French Jews, 60,000 Dutch Jews, and 55,000 Greek Jews. The Polish scholar Franciszek Piper, the chief historian of Auschwitz, estimates that 140,000 to 150,000 Poles were brought to that camp between 1940 and 1945, and that 70,000 to 75,000 died there as victims of executions, of medical experiments, and of starvation and disease. There were also hundreds of thousands of victims at concentration camps in Majdanek, Treblinka, and Warsaw.",

        "Austrian victory at the naval Battle of Lissa Except for Saxony, the other German states allied to Austria played little role in the main campaign. Hanover's army defeated Prussia at the Second Battle of Langensalza on 27 June 1866, but, within a few days, they were forced to surrender by superior numbers. Prussian armies fought against Bavaria, Wurttemberg, Baden and the Hessian states on the river Main, reaching Nuremberg and Frankfurt. The Bavarian fortress of Wurzburg was shelled by Prussian artillery, but the garrison defended its position until armistice day. The Austrians were more successful in their war with Italy, defeating the Italians on land at the Battle of Custoza , and on sea at the Battle of Lissa . However, Italy's \"Hunters of the Alps\" led by Garibaldi defeated the Austrians at the Battle of Bezzecca on 21 July, conquered the lower part of Trentino, and moved towards Trento. The Prussian peace with Austria forced the Italian government to seek an armistice with Austria on 12 August. According to the Treaty of Vienna, signed on 12 October, Austria ceded Veneto to France, which, in turn, ceded it to Italy.",

He would snatch babies from their mothers' arms and tear them to pieces in his hands.  I saw him beat two men to death with a rifle, because they did not carry out his instructions properly, since they did not understand German.  I remember that one night a group of youths aged fifteen or sixteen arrived in the camp.  The head of this group was one Abraham.  After a long and arduous work day, this young man collapsed on his pallet and fell asleep.  Suddenly Wagner came into our barrack, and Abraham did not hear him call to stand up at once before him.  Furious, he pulled Abraham naked off his bed and began to beat him all over his body.  When Wagner grew weary of the blows, he took out his revolver and killed him on the spot.  This atrocious spectacle was carried out before all of us, including Abraham's younger brother. Erich Bauer would later remark:",

When the Russians advanced to Poland in January 1945, the Germans evacuated 66,000 Jewish prisoners, and sent them on a death march to Buchenwald. At the time of his arrival there, Paltiel's weight was 39\u00a0kg. One day, the prisoners got the message that the Scandinavians were going to be released and sent in the white buses back to their home countries, but to Paltiel's misfortune, Quisling had removed the Norwegian Jews' citizenship so they were not included on the evacuation lists.

        "Opposition to homosexuality Further information: Persecution of homosexuals in Nazi Germany and the Holocaust  Homophobia: Berlin memorial to homosexual victims of the Holocaust: Totgeschlagen \u2013 Totgeschwiegen  After the Night of the Long Knives, Hitler promoted Himmler and the SS, who then zealously suppressed homosexuality by saying: \"We must exterminate these people root and branch ... the homosexual must be eliminated\". In 1936, Himmler established the \"Reichszentrale zur Bekampfung der Homosexualitat und Abtreibung\" . The Nazi regime incarcerated some 100,000 homosexuals during the 1930s. As concentration camp prisoners, homosexual men were forced to wear pink triangle badges. Nazi ideology still viewed German men who were gay as a part of the Aryan master race, but the Nazi regime attempted to force them into sexual and social conformity. Homosexuals were viewed as failing in their duty to procreate and reproduce for the Aryan nation. Gay men who would not change or feign a change in their sexual orientation were sent to concentration camps under the \"Extermination Through Work\" campaign.",

She was also an intern at the hospital Rikshospitalet in 1900, before studying children's and women's illnesses abroad. She was never hired in an academic position, but conducted research together with her husband, who was a professor. They released textbooks on the human organism for university students in three volumes between 1918 and 1921, and a textbook for school students in 1923. Her most read book was Slegtslivet hos menneskene. In the 1920s the couple became more involved in physical anthropology. She released Antropologische Studien an norwegische Frauen in 1924, Die Nord-Norweger. Anthropologische Untersuchungen an Soldaten in 1929 and two books under the moniker Anthropologische Lokaluntersuchungen in 1930 and 1932. Neither of them delved into the Nazi type of racial hygiene. Her husband and son were even imprisoned by Nazis in Grini concentration camp. However, Alette Schreiner held that all races contained elements with unsatisfactory genetics. Schreiner also helped establishing Blindern studenthjem, the sole students' dormitory at Blindern. She died in December 1951 in Oslo.",

        "Increased brutality in the camp As the war went on, conditions in camp became even more brutal and harsh, and penalties such as standing on broken glass were introduced.  In 1943 a transport of 543 children from the regions of Smolensk and Vitebsk arrived. Some of the children were treated as normal prisoners, even when they were as young as two years old. As the children were ill from Typhoid fever, the Germans placed them in separate, primitive-condition barracks that were separated by barbed wire.  In 1944 the conditions in the camp reached their most brutal phase.  Children were regularly called \"children of bandits\", were beaten and kicked by camp personnel, and were forced to dig trenches. Most of the children had fallen ill, and many died from exhaustion, maltreatment, hunger or disease. Infants were cared for by the older children. There are also witness statements about the deliberate murder of children by camp personnel. One witness described in detail how he had seen three children approximately 7 years old being drowned by Germans near the camp. According to him, Germans first threw the children into a water canal and then threw bricks at them, looking satisfied.",

        "Life He published his first volume of poetry in 1933 before the Nazi occupation of Poland, during which Wygodzki was first interred in the Bedzin ghetto and later in the concentration camps of Auschwitz, Dachau, Oranienburg and Sachsenhausen. During the war he was issued Paraguayan passport by Lados Group. His health impacted by his experiences, Wygodzki did not resume publishing until 1947, following which he became a successful writer, publishing poetry, short stories and one novel. Wygodzki, who lost his wife, daughter and parents in Auschwitz, was one of four winners of the 1969 \"Remembrance Award\", awarded annually by the World Federation of Bergen-Belsen Associations for \"excellence in literature on the Nazi atrocities against European Jewry\". A communist in his youth who was briefly imprisoned in Poland as an adult for his communist activities, Wygodzki resettled in Israel in 1968 in response to antisemitism in the Communist Party in Poland.",

Unsourced material may be challenged and removed.   After World War I and the dissolution of Austria-Hungary sealed by the 1919 Treaty of Saint-Germain, three political camps controlled the fate of the Austrian First Republic: the Social Democrats, the Christian Social Party, and the German nationalists, organised in the Greater German People's Party and the Landbund. Since 1921 the Christian Social Party had formed coalition governments along with the German nationalists; Chancellor Ignaz Seipel, a proponent of Catholic social teaching, advocated the idea of a \"corporated\" state surmounting the parliamentary system, based on the encyclicals Rerum novarum  by Pope Leo XIII and Quadragesimo anno  by Pope Pius XI.",

I did not consider myself justified to exterminate the men only \u2013 in other words, to kill them or have them killed while allowing the avengers, in the form of their children, to grow up in the midst of our sons and grandsons. The difficult decision had to be made to have this people disappear from the earth.\u2014\u2009Heinrich Himmler, 6 October 1943 On 19 October 1943, five days after the prisoner revolt in Sobibor, Operation Reinhard was terminated by Odilo Globocnik on behalf of Himmler. The camps responsible for the killing of nearly 2,700,000 Jews were soon closed. Belzec, Sobibor, and Treblinka were dismantled and ploughed over before spring. The operation was followed by the single largest German massacre of Jews in the entire war carried out on 3 November 1943; with approximately 43,000 prisoners shot one-by-one simultaneously in three nearby locations by the Reserve Police Battalion 101 hand-in-hand with the Trawniki men from Ukraine. Auschwitz alone had enough capacity to fulfill the Nazis' remaining extermination needs.",

        "Memorials  \"The 102,000 stones\u00a0\" monument at Westerbork. Each individual stone represents a single person that stayed at Westerbork and died in Nazi concentration and extermination camps. A museum was created two miles from Westerbork to keep the memories of those imprisoned in the camp alive. As a tribute to those inmates who had died after deportation, a memorial was commissioned; it consists of 102,000 stones, representing each person who was deported from Westerbork and never returned. The National Westerbork Memorial was unveiled at the site by Queen Juliana of the Netherlands on 4 May 1970. Also, a monument of a broken railroad track torn from the ground is displayed near the camp to symbolize the destruction the camp, as well as others, wrought on the European Jewish population, and the determination that the tracks would never again carry people to their deaths. In 2017, films commissioned by the German camp commander Albert Gemmeker from a Jewish prisoner, Rudolf Breslauer, to document everyday life in the Westerbork transit camp, were submitted by the Netherlands and included in UNESCO's Memory of the World Register.",

        "United States See also: Japanese-American internment, German-American internment, and Italian-American internment A well-known example of enemy aliens were the Japanese citizens residing in the United States during World War II. Many of these Japanese and Japanese Americans were imprisoned in internment camps by President Roosevelt during wartime, alongside many German- and Italian-Americans. However, many Japanese Americans and Italian-Americans were not actually \"aliens\", as they held American citizenship. The term \"enemy alien\" referred only to non-American citizens who were nationals of Axis countries. Included in this number were thousands of resident aliens who were prohibited from applying for citizenship by race-based naturalization laws; when war was declared against their native countries, their status changed from \"resident\" to \"enemy\" alien.  Therefore, German American, Italian American and Japanese American permanent residents were classified as enemy aliens and interned as such. In total 10,905 Italian Americans and approximately 110,000 Japanese Americans were interned in many different camps and sites across the country.  German Americans were held in more than 50 different locations.",

        "Location The camp was situated in the locality called Mittelsteine  in what was then the territory of the Third Reich, about 17\u00a0kilometres to the north\u00ad-west of Klodzko , the nearest larger town, or 104\u00a0kilometres to the south-west of the regional metropolis, Wroclaw  \u2014 in the territory of Lower Silesia that was awarded to Poland after the War. Despite its picturesque geographical location in the so-called Steine Depression  between the Table Moun\u00adtains and the Stone Moun\u00adtains and its history reaching back to the 14th century, Mittelsteine was before the Second World War a highly industrialized village.  The hamlet was, for example, the site of a major power plant that supplied electricity to the electrified Silesian grid  of the German railway system  considered one of the most valuable assets of the Reich. It was a major railway junction already in the 19th century. Mittelsteine was thus a natural choice for the location of various industries. Today, the border crossing between the Czech Republic and Poland at Otovice\u2013Tlumaczow is just 8\u00bd\u00a0km or 5\u00a0miles away; while the nearest town in Germany, Zittau, is 179\u00a0km or 111 miles away.",

In Polish historiography the events surrounding the Nazi German roundups are often named alternatively as the Children of Zamojszczyzna to emphasize the apprehension of around 30,000 children at that time, snatched away from their parents who were transported from Zamojszczyzna to concentration camps. The expulsions encompassed the districts of Hrubieszow, Tomaszow Lubelski, Zamosc and Bilgoraj, and were completed in March 1943. In total 297 Polish villages were depopulated.",

        "In popular culture The airmen in the show Hogan's Heroes were imprisoned in fictitious \"Luft Stalag 13\" near Hammelburg. The World War II play Stalag 17, which was made into the 1953 movie Stalag 17, was set in Stalag XVII-B, located near Krems, Austria. The movie Hart's War was set in Stalag VI-A, near Hemer/Iserlohn in Military District VI. In Israel of the 1950s\u20131960s, \"stalag\" was a generic term for pornographic material with a theme of sadistic sexual activity between female SS officers and prisoners of war. In 2007, Ari Libsker made a film on this topic, entitled Stalags. In 1993, the British TV movie Stalag Luft, starring Stephen Fry, featured a prisoner of war camp in which the German guards have abandoned the prisoners.",

        "Lifting of the Iron Curtain, 1990s\u2013present With the fall of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of the Soviet Union during the early 1990s, neo-Nazism began to spread its ideas in the East, as hostility to the triumphant liberal order was high and revanchism a widespread feeling. In Russia, during the chaos of the early 1990s, an amorphous mixture of KGB hardliners, Orthodox neo-Tsarist nostalgics  and explicit Neo-Nazis found themselves strewn together in the same camp. They were united by opposition to the influence of the United States, against the liberalising legacy of Mikhail Gorbachev's perestroika and on the Jewish question, Soviet Zionology merged with a more explicit anti-Jewish sentiment. The most significant organisation representing this was Russian National Unity under the leadership of Alexander Barkashov, where black-uniform clad Russians marched with a red flag incorporating the Swastika under the banner of Russia for Russians. These forces came together in a last gasp effort to save the Supreme Soviet of Russia against Boris Yeltsin during the 1993 Russian constitutional crisis. As well as events in Russia, in newly independent ex-Soviet states, annual commemorations for SS volunteers now took place; particularly in Latvia, Estonia and the Ukraine.",

        "World War II At the beginning of the Second World War Wagner was Naval Attache in Madrid, Spain. The \"Wagner Campaign\" was named after him, via which from January to August 1940 300 tons of strategic commodities, mainly tungsten, were exported from Spain to Germany for war materials use. The transaction was accounted with deliveries of German arms, mercenary services and transports to Spain. Still after 1 September 1939, the outbreak of World War II, airplane parts were delivered to Spain. The German exports to Spain which had increased during the Spanish Civil War were mainly carried out by sea. With the outbreak of World War 2 the Allies tried to block this sea route trade, and \"the Wagner campaign\" was devised to organize German merchant ships that were stuck thereafter in Spanish ports changing their flags and partially subscribe them to Spanish entrepreneur Juan March.",

        "Hitler with Nazi Party members in December 1930 Against this backdrop, Hitler's party gained a victory in the Reichstag, obtaining 107 seats  in the September 1930 federal election. The Nazis became the second largest party in Germany. In Bavaria the party gained 17.9% of the vote, though for the first time this percentage was exceeded by most other provinces: Oldenburg , Braunschweig , Waldeck , Mecklenburg-Strelitz , Lippe  Mecklenburg-Schwerin , Anhalt , Thuringen , Baden , Hamburg , Prussia , Hessen , Sachsen , Lubeck  and Schaumburg-Lippe . An unprecedented amount of money was thrown behind the campaign. Well over one million pamphlets were produced and distributed; sixty trucks were commandeered for use in Berlin alone. In areas where Nazi campaigning was less rigorous, the total was as low as 9%. The Great Depression was also a factor in Hitler's electoral success. Against this legal backdrop, the SA began its first major anti-Jewish action on 13 October 1930 when groups of brownshirts smashed the windows of Jewish-owned stores at Potsdamer Platz.",

Benedictine abbey in Orlova  in the late 13th century had rights to revenues from three villages in the Castellany of Raciborz, namely Gorzyce, Uchylsko and Golkowice. The village was annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia in 1742 after the First Silesian War. As Gross Gorschutz, it became part of the German Empire in 1871 and was ceded to the Second Polish Republic after World War I.  During World War II, Gorzyce was the location of the Polenlager 168, a Nazi concentration camp of Polenlager type, i.e., primarily for Poles. The building of the transport depot at Lesna street, Gorzyce, holds a memorial plaque. The collective grave of the inmates is at the cemetery at Gorzyce.",

        "The three Gusen concentration camps held a significant proportion of prisoners within the Mauthausen-Gusen complex. For most of its history, this exceeded the number of prisoners at the Mauthausen main camp itself. DEST began purchasing land at St Georgen/Gusen in May 1938. During 1938 and 1939, inmates of the nearby Mauthausen makeshift camp marched daily to the granite quarries at St Georgen/Gusen, which were more productive and more important for DEST than the Wienergraben Quarry.  After Germany invaded Poland in September 1939, the as-yet unfinished Mauthausen camp was already overcrowded with prisoners. The numbers of inmates rose from 1,080 in late 1938 to over 3,000 a year later. At about that time, the construction of a new camp \"for the Poles\" began in Gusen about 4.5 kilometres  away. The new camp  became operational in May 1940. The first inmates were put in the first two huts  on 17 April 1940, while the first transport of prisoners\u00a0\u2013 mostly from the camps in Dachau and Sachsenhausen\u00a0\u2013 arrived just over a month later, on 25 May.",

        "Early career Zolkiewski gained his first military experience under King Stefan Batory during the Danzig rebellion in which he commanded a rota of Polish hussars. He subsequently participated in Batory's Livonian campaign, fighting at Polotsk, Rossony , Velizh and at the Siege of Pskov. Zolkiewski maintained his political alliance with the Zamoyski family after those campaigns ended, particularly in their conflict with the Zborowscy. On the night of 11 to 12 May 1584 he captured Samuel Zborowski, whose subsequent execution caused much controversy. Zolkiewski became notorious for his role in the incident, and was the subject of heated debates during the Sejm of 1585. In 1588, during the War of the Polish Succession between factions of Sigismund III Vasa and Maximilian III, Zolkiewski supported Sigismund. Zolkiewski commanded the right flank of Commonwealth forces in the battle of Byczyna, during which he received a knee wound that lamed him for the remainder of his life. For his part in the battle he was appointed a Field Crown Hetman, and became the starost of Hrubieszow.",

The Route Dora Schaul  leads past the site of the former women's internment camp in which Dora Schaul spent several months until her escape.  Her son, Peter Schaul, was present at the renaming ceremony:  he spoke of his pride and satisfaction that at a time when the past is in danger of disappearing into oblivion, there were still moves to turn back the wheel of history, \"because there is a local community in France, a country that suffered under German occupation, naming a street after a German anti-Fascist.   I find that remarkable, courageous and gratifying, and it makes me all the more determined to do what is in my power to see to it that the demon of Fascism is given no chance .\" On 8 August 2009, which was the tenth anniversary of her death, a commemorative tablet was placed on the outside of the house at Dammweg 73 in Berlin-Treptow.   The house was home to Dora Schaul during her final years.   The inscription reads as follows:",

        "Plan of Fohrenwald DP camp in Bavaria  Class portrait of school children at Schauenstein DP camp, about 1946 Displaced persons camps in post-World War II Europe were established in Germany, Austria, and Italy, primarily for refugees from Eastern Europe and for the former inmates of the Nazi German concentration camps. A \"displaced persons camp\" is a temporary facility for displaced persons, whether refugees or internally displaced persons. Two years after the end of World War II in Europe, some 850,000 people lived in displaced persons camps across Europe, among them Armenians, Poles, Latvians, Lithuanians, Estonians, Yugoslavs, Jews, Greeks, Russians, Ukrainians, Hungarians and Czechoslovaks. At the end of the Second World War, at least 11 million people had been displaced from their home countries, with about seven million in Allied-occupied Germany. These included former prisoners of war, released slave laborers, and both non-Jewish and Jewish concentration-camp survivors. The Allies categorized the refugees as \u201cdisplaced persons\u201d  and assigned the responsibility for their care to the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration .",

        "Oppression at home The Holocaust Further information: The Holocaust in Hungary On 19 March 1944 German troops occupied Hungary, prime minister Miklos Kallay was deposed and soon mass deportations of Jews to German death camps in occupied Poland began. SS-Obersturmbannfuhrer Adolf Eichmann went to Hungary to oversee the large-scale deportations. Between 15 May and 9 July, Hungarian authorities deported 437,402 Jews. All but 15,000 of these Jews were sent to Auschwitz-Birkenau, and 90% of those were immediately killed. It has been estimated that one-third of the murdered victims at Auschwitz were Hungarian. Sztojay, unlike previous prime ministers, answered mostly to Berlin and was thus able to act independently of Horthy. However, reports of the conditions in the concentration camps led the admiral to resist his policies.",

Actions were started on a similar scale in other Polish areas annexed by Nazi Germany. According to many historians, including Norman Davies, the action against Polish leaders was coordinated with the authorities of the Soviet Union, who at the same time perpetrated the mass murder of 22,000 Polish military officers at Katyn and other places. The active persecution of Polish intellectuals was continued until the end of the war. The direct continuation of the AB Action was a German campaign in the east started after the German invasion of the USSR. Among the most notable mass executions of Polish professors was the massacre of Lwow professors, in which approximately 45 professors of the university in Lwow were murdered together with their families and guests. Among those killed in the massacre were Tadeusz Boy-Zelenski, former Polish prime minister Kazimierz Bartel, Wlodzimierz Stozek,  and Stanislaw Ruziewicz. Thousands more perished in the Ponary massacre, in German concentration camps, and in ghettos.",

Since many politicians, academics and cultural personalities were detained at Grini, a certain level of internal organization was established. Prisoners worked in manufacturing, agriculture and other manual labor. Much of this manual labor took place outside the camp. Some detainees maintained their pre-war specialties, such as literary historian Francis Bull who secretly held several lectures, and managed to publish three books with material written during his three-year stay at Grini. The diet at Grini was poor.  After the war, it caused a certain stir in the populace when it was perceived that Nazi prisoners of the liberated Norway were treated better than prisoners of the Nazi regime; among other things the diet in Norwegian prisons was much better. On the other hand, Grini was more hospitable to resistance prisoners than the similar camps in Germany.",

        "Occupations On arrival, he was not sent to death in the gas chambers because he proved to be a goldsmith, having carried along his bag of tools. He also managed to protect his brother, cousin, and nephew, insisting he needed their assistance. Given a makeshift goldsmith workshop, he was tasked by camp deputy commander Gustav Wagner to create golden accessories for the members of the SS at Sobibor using stolen coins, jewelry, or dental gold of murder victims. Orders included rings displaying SS runes and an ornamental knob for the whip used by Kurt Bolender in beating the prisoners. Under Franz Stangl's command of the camp, Szmajzner was made foreman in a mechanics workshop, tasked with general maintenance. Later, he and others were forced to produce the very mines laid around the camp's outer fence. His job gave him wide access, except for camp III, the area of gassing and burning of victims.",

See Wikipedia:Summary style for information on how to properly incorporate it into this article's main text.  Following the Russo-Turkish War , in June and July 1878 the Congress of Berlin was organized by the Great Powers. The resulting Treaty of Berlin caused Bosnia and Herzegovina to nominally remain under sovereignty of the Ottoman Empire, but was de facto ceded to Austria-Hungary, which also obtained the right to garrison the Sanjak of Novi Pazar.

        "The Vistula\u2013Oder Offensive was a Red Army operation on the Eastern Front in the European theatre of World War II in January 1945. The army made a major advance into German-held territory, capturing Krakow, Warsaw and Poznan. The Red Army had built up their strength around a number of key bridgeheads, with two fronts commanded by Marshal Georgy Zhukov and Marshal Ivan Konev. Against them, the German Army Group A, led by Colonel-General Josef Harpe , was outnumbered five to one. Within days, German commandants evacuated the concentration camps, sending the prisoners on their death marches to the west, where ethnic Germans also started fleeing. In a little over two weeks, the Red Army had advanced 300 miles  from the Vistula to the Oder, only 43 miles  from Berlin, which was undefended. However, Zhukov called a halt, owing to continued German resistance on his northern flank , and the advance on Berlin had to be delayed until April.",

        "History Spandau Prison was built in 1876 on Wilhelmstrasse. It initially served as a military detention center. From 1919 it was also used for civilian inmates. It held up to 600 inmates at that time. In the aftermath of the Reichstag fire of 1933, opponents of Hitler, and journalists such as Egon Kisch and Carl von Ossietzky, were held there in so-called protective custody. Spandau Prison became a sort of predecessor of the Nazi concentration camps. While it was formally operated by the Prussian Ministry of Justice, the Gestapo tortured and abused its inmates, as Kisch recalled in his memories of the prison. By the end of 1933 the first Nazi concentration camps had been erected ; all remaining prisoners who had been held in so-called protective custody in state prisons were transferred to these concentration camps. After World War II the prison fell in the British Sector of what became West Berlin but it was operated by the Four-Power Authorities to house the Nazi war criminals sentenced to imprisonment at the Nuremberg Trials. Only seven prisoners were finally imprisoned there. Arriving from Nuremberg on 18 July 1947, they were:",

Next morning in the course of my duties I had to clear the ashes out of the crematorium oven. I found a pink woman's stocking garter on the floor near the oven. More than one witness talked of a struggle when the fourth woman was shoved into the furnace. According to a Polish prisoner named Walter Schultz, the SS medical orderly  told him the following: \"When the last woman was halfway in the oven , she had come to her senses and struggled. As there were sufficient men there, they were able to push her into the oven, but not before she had resisted and scratched  Straub's face.\" The next day Schultz noticed that the face of the camp executioner  had been severely scratched. The camp doctor  was executed after the war. Franz Berg was sentenced to five years in prison but received the death penalty in another trial for a different crime and was hanged on the same day as Rohde. The camp commandant  received a life sentence, while Straub was sentenced to 13 years in prison.",

On this site, where many of the original structures were demolished and which was later occupied by the Soviet army, little of the original layout remained intact.  The winning scheme proposed an excavation of the site by volunteers, gradually creating a surface relief.  This process would expose old foundations and the layout of the camp, whose borders would then be reforested to accentuate the boundaries.  At the section of the site where youth were detained, a field of flowers acts as a memorial where no other visual traces remain.<ref>Mead 1998, p. 40</ref>",

Among the companies that benefited from the slave labour of the concentration camp inmates were German electronics manufacturers such as Blaupunkt, Siemens, as well as Krupp, IG Farben, and Daimler-Benz, among others. Some prisoners who were not able to work but not yet dying were sent to the Dachau concentration camp in so-called invalid transports. The largest population of inmates, however, were Jews, initially from the Dachau and Sachsenhausen camps, and later from Buchenwald. During the camp's existence, the Jewish inmate population came mainly from Poland and Hungary; others were from Belgium, France, Netherlands, Greece, Yugoslavia, Slovakia, and Italy.",

Envoys from Haganah headed by Yehuda Arazi received dozens of shipments with military supplies, including 2750 Mauser rifles, 225 RKM machine guns, 10,000 hand grenades, two million bullets for rifles and machine guns, and a large number of pistols with ammunition. The British exerted heavy pressure on the Polish government to stop these deliveries. One of the last purchases of Arazi were two airplanes and two gliders. When he fled Poland to France, around 500 rifles were abandoned in a Warsaw warehouse. Members of the Haganah were also trained in a military camp in Rembertow along with Betar members between the years 1931 and 1937; it is estimated that training courses at the camp were attended by around 8,000 to 10,000 participants during their existence.",

They typically served as local security police augmenting German units of the Gestapo, SD, and other main departments of the Reich Main Security Office. The Allgemeine-SS also consisted of the SS-Frauenkorps  which was an auxiliary reporting and clerical unit, which included the SS-Helferinnenkorps , made up of female volunteers.  Members were assigned as administrative staff and supply personnel, and served in command positions and as guards at women's concentration camps in places such as Ravensbruck concentration camp. Like their male equivalents in the SS, females participated in atrocities against Jews, Poles, and others. In 1942, Himmler set up the Reichsschule fur SS Helferinnen  in Oberehnheim to train women in communications so that they could free up men for combat roles. Himmler also intended to replace all female civilian employees in his service with SS-Helferinnen members, as they were selected and trained according to NSDAP ideology. The school was closed on 22 November 1944 due to the Allied advance.",

        "Subcamps Further information: List of subcamps of Auschwitz Several other German industrial enterprises, such as Krupp and Siemens-Schuckert, built factories with their own subcamps. There were around 28 camps near industrial plants, each camp holding hundreds or thousands of prisoners. Designated as Aussenlager , Nebenlager , Arbeitslager , or Aussenkommando , camps were built at Blechhammer, Jawiszowice, Jaworzno, Lagisze, Myslowice, Trzebinia, and as far afield as the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia in Czechoslovakia. Industries with satellite camps included coal mines, foundries and other metal works, and chemical plants. Prisoners were also made to work in forestry and farming. For example, Wirtschaftshof Budy, in the Polish village of Budy near Brzeszcze, was a farming subcamp where prisoners worked 12-hour days in the fields. Their duties involved tending animals, and making compost by mixing human ashes from the crematoria with sod and manure. Incidents of sabotage to decrease production took place in several subcamps, including Charlottengrube, Gleiwitz II, and Rajsko. Living conditions in some of the camps were so poor that they were regarded as punishment subcamps.",

During the same month, the Jewish community leaders from Berlin and Vienna arrived, and the leadership was reorganized to include Paul Eppstein, a German Zionist, and Benjamin Murmelstein, an Austrian rabbi; Edelstein was forced to act as Eppstein's deputy. At the beginning of February, Ernst Kaltenbrunner, head of the RSHA, proposed the deportation of an additional five thousand elderly Jews. SS chief Heinrich Himmler refused, due to the increasing need for Theresienstadt as an alibi to conceal information on the Holocaust reaching the Western Allies. There were no more transports from Theresienstadt until the deportation of 5,000 Jews to the Theresienstadt family camp at Auschwitz in September.",

Some six million Polish citizens perished in the war \u2013 half of those  being killed at the German extermination camps at Auschwitz, Treblinka, Majdanek, Belzec, Sobibor, and Chelmno or starved to death in the ghettos. Poland was where the German program of extermination of Jews, the \"Final Solution\", was implemented, since this was where most of Europe's Jews    lived. In 1939 several hundred synagogues were blown up or burned by the Germans, who sometimes forced the Jews to do it themselves. In many cases, the Germans turned the synagogues into factories, places of entertainment, swimming pools, or prisons. By war's end, almost all the synagogues in Poland had been destroyed. Rabbis were forced to dance and sing in public with their beards shorn off. Some rabbis were set on fire or hanged.",

Liggett was born in Reading, Pennsylvania.  After his graduation from West Point as an infantry lieutenant in 1879, field service in the American West, the Spanish\u2013American War, and the Philippine\u2013American War honed his skills as a troop leader. Success in brigade commands in Texas and in the Philippines led to his selection as commander of the 41st Infantry Division in France in 1917. When his division was disestablished, he took command of I Corps. Under Liggett's leadership, the corps participated in the Second Battle of the Marne and in the reduction of the Saint-Mihiel Salient. In October 1918, as commander of the U.S. First Army, he directed the final phases of the Meuse-Argonne Offensive and the pursuit of German forces until the armistice. After commanding the U.S. Third Army also known as the Army of Occupation on the Rhine bridgeheads, Hunter Liggett retired in 1921. Read more...",

The battle lasted from 10 May 1940 until the surrender of the main Dutch forces on 14 May. Dutch troops in the province of Zealand continued to resist the Wehrmacht until 17 May when Germany completed its occupation of the whole country. The Battle of the Netherlands saw some of the earliest mass paratroop drops, to occupy tactical points and assist the advance of ground troops. The German Luftwaffe used paratroopers in the capture of several airfields in the vicinity of Rotterdam and The Hague, helping to quickly overrun the country and immobilise Dutch forces. After the devastating bombing of Rotterdam by the Luftwaffe on 14 May, the Germans threatened to bomb other Dutch cities if the Dutch forces refused to surrender. The General Staff knew it could not stop the bombers and ordered the Dutch Army to cease hostilities. The last occupied parts of the Netherlands were liberated in 1945.",

        "Allied POWs Main article: Allied airmen at Buchenwald concentration camp Although it was highly unusual for German authorities to send Western Allied POWs to concentration camps, Buchenwald held a group of 168 aviators for two months. These men were from the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Jamaica. They all arrived at Buchenwald on August 20, 1944. All these airmen were in aircraft that had crashed in occupied France. Two explanations are given for them being sent to a concentration camp: first, that they had managed to make contact with the French Resistance, some were disguised as civilians, and they were carrying false papers when caught; they were therefore categorized by the Germans as spies, which meant their rights under the Geneva Convention were not respected. The second explanation is that they had been categorised as Terrorflieger . The aviators were initially held in Gestapo prisons and headquarters in France. In April or August 1944, they and other Gestapo prisoners were packed into covered goods wagons  and sent to Buchenwald. The journey took five days, during which they received very little food or water.",

        "Collaboration See also: National Socialist Movement in the Netherlands and Nederlandsche SS  Anton Mussert, leader of the NSB, speaking at a rally in The Hague in 1941 Many Dutch men and women chose or were forced to collaborate with the German regime or joined the German armed forces . Others, like members of the Henneicke Column, were actively involved in capturing hiding Jews for a price and delivering them to the German occupiers. It is estimated that the Henneicke Column captured around 8,000-9,000 Dutch Jews who were ultimately sent to their death in the German death camps. The National Socialist Movement in the Netherlands was the only legal political party in the Netherlands from 1941 and was actively involved in collaboration with the German occupiers. In 1941, when Germany still seemed certain to win the war, about three percent of the adult male population belonged to the NSB.",

        "Support from Poland During the interwar period, as part of its policy of supporting a Jewish state in Palestine in order to facilitate mass Jewish emigration from its territory, the Second Polish Republic provided military training and weapons to Zionist paramilitary groups, including Haganah. Envoys from Haganah headed by Yehuda Arazi received dozens of shipments with military supplies, including 2750 Mauser rifles, 225 RKM machine guns, 10,000 hand grenades, two million bullets for rifles and machine guns, and a large number of pistols with ammunition. The British exerted heavy pressure on the Polish government to stop these deliveries. One of the last purchases of Arazi were two airplanes and two gliders. When he fled Poland to France, around 500 rifles were abandoned in a Warsaw warehouse. Members of the Haganah were also trained in a military camp in Rembertow along with Betar members between the years 1931 and 1937; it is estimated that training courses at the camp were attended by around 8,000 to 10,000 participants during their existence.",

A crematorium that was next to, but not directly accessible from within the camp, was erected in 1942. KZ Dachau was therefore the longest running concentration camp of the Third Reich.

The Gestapo arrested Beran on 6 June 1942 during World War II  and he was later imprisoned without trial in Pankrac at Theresienstadt  and also the Dachau concentration camp. From 6 June 1942 until 6 July he was held in Pankrac before being sent for two months to Terzin. He arrived at Dachau on 4 September 1942 where his number was 25844. It was there that a typhoid epidemic in 1943 almost killed him but he rallied from it and remained there until 29 April 1945 after Allied forces liberated the camp.

At a large public demonstration on 3 December in Warsaw, he denounced the negotiations between the Government and Grand Duke Constantine, who was encamped outside the city. Mochnacki advocated a military campaign in Lithuania so as to spare the country the devastation of war and preserve the local food supply. The meeting adopted a number of demands to be communicated to the Administrative Council, including the establishment of a revolutionary government and an immediate attack upon the forces of Constantine.

        "Germany and Nazi-occupied Europe Main article: The Holocaust  Ia\u0219i pogrom in Romania, June 1941 The first pogrom in Nazi Germany was the Kristallnacht, often called Pogromnacht, in which at least 91 Jews were killed, a further 30,000 arrested and incarcerated in Nazi concentration camps, over 1,000 synagogues burned, and over 7,000 Jewish businesses destroyed or damaged. During World War II, Nazi German death squads encouraged local populations in German-occupied Europe to commit pogroms against Jews. Brand new battalions of Volksdeutscher Selbstschutz  were mobilized from among the German minorities. A large number of pogroms occurred during the Holocaust at the hands of non-Germans. Perhaps the deadliest of these Holocaust-era pogroms was the Ia\u0219i pogrom in Romania, perpetrated by Ion Antonescu, in which as many as 13,266 Jews were killed by Romanian citizens, police and military officials. On 1\u20132 June 1941, in the two-day Farhud pogrom in Iraq, perpetrated by Rashid Ali, Yunis al-Sabawi, and the al-Futuwa youth, \"rioters murdered between 150 and 180 Jews, injured 600 others, and raped an undetermined number of women. They also looted some 1,500 stores and homes\". Also 300-400 non-Jewish rioters were killed in the attempt to quell the violence.",

They comprised the V-1, a pulsejet-powered cruise missile; the V-2, a liquid-fuelled ballistic missile ; and the V-3 cannon. All of these weapons were intended for use in a military campaign against Britain, though only the V-1 and V-2 were so used in a campaign conducted 1944\u201345. After the invasion of Europe by the Allies, these weapons were also employed against targets on the mainland of Europe, mainly France and Belgium. Terror bombing with V-weapons killed approximately 18,000 people, mostly civilians. The cities of London, Antwerp and Liege were the main targets. They were part of the range of the so-called Wunderwaffen  of Nazi Germany.",

The Germans hesitated to risk a tank attack on the city, fearing heavy casualties. Instead, the German commander presented an ultimatum to the Dutch commander in the city. He demanded the surrender of the Dutch garrison and threatened to destroy the city by aerial bombing if they did not accept. The ultimatum was returned on a technicality, since it had not been signed by the German commander. While the corrected ultimatum was being resubmitted, Luftwaffe bombers  struck the city. During the so-called \"Rotterdam Blitz\", between 800 and 900 Dutch civilians were killed, and 25,000 homes were destroyed. The bombers' targets were the civilian areas of Rotterdam, rather than the town's defenses. Under pressure from local officials, the garrison commander surrendered the city and his 10,000 men on the evening of the 14th, with the permission of Henri Winkelman, the Dutch commander-in-chief. This opened up the German advance into \"Fortress Holland\".",

The Luftwaffe killed 6,000 to 7,000 Polish civilians during the bombing of Warsaw. The German invasion saw atrocities committed against Polish men, women and children. The German forces  murdered tens of thousands of Polish civilians  and committing atrocities in numerous Polish towns, including massacres in Blonie, Zloczew, Boleslawiec, Torzeniec, Goworowo, Mlawa and Wloclawek).

Although initially the camps of Gusen and Mauthausen mostly served the local quarries, from 1942 onwards they began to be included in the German war machine. To accommodate the ever-growing number of slave workers, additional subcamps  of Mauthausen were built.  By the end of the war, the list included 101 camps  which covered most of modern Austria, from Mittersill south of Salzburg to Schwechat east of Vienna and from Passau on the prewar Austro-German border to the Loibl Pass on the border with Yugoslavia. The subcamps were divided into several categories, depending on their main function: Produktionslager for factory workers, Baulager for construction, Aufraumlager for cleaning the rubble in Allied-bombed towns, and Kleinlager  where the inmates were working specifically for the SS.",

This time the Germans had to allow us into the camp as most of the passengers could not walk the minor distance from the barracks to the road. From these barracks a group of creatures were forced, that hardly anymore seemed to be human beings. The last transport for the SS was undertaken as late as 13 April, with around 450 so-called prominent French prisoners  who the Germans stated would be repatriated through Switzerland. According to the plan, the prisoners would be delivered to the concentration camp at Flossenburg. From there they should be transported to Switzerland by the Swiss Red Cross. The promise of the transport to Switzerland was a lie and that camp was full, so the prisoners were taken to Theresienstadt where the \"white buses\" were heading to pick up 400 Danish Jews.",

A new barracks and barbed wire fencing 2 metres  tall were erected in late 1941. To obtain the workforce for Treblinka I, civilians were sent to the camp en masse for real or imagined offences, and sentenced to hard labour by the Gestapo office in Sokolow, which was headed by Gramss. The average length of a sentence was six months, but many prisoners had their sentences extended indefinitely. Twenty thousand people passed through Treblinka I during its three-year existence. About half of them died there from exhaustion, hunger and disease. Those who survived were released after serving their sentences; these were generally Poles from nearby villages.",

        "Architecture See also: Pretoria Forts  Media related to Buildings in Pretoria at Wikimedia Commons Pretoria has over the years had very diverse cultural influences and this is reflected in the architectural styles that can be found in the city. It ranges from 19th century Dutch, German and British colonial architecture to modern, postmodern, neomodern, and art deco architecture styles with a good mix of a uniquely South African style. Some of the notable structures in Pretoria include the late 19th century Palace of Justice, the early 20th century Union Buildings, the post-war Voortrekker Monument, the diverse buildings dotting the main campuses of both the University of Pretoria and the University of South Africa, traditional Cape Dutch style Mahlamba Ndlopfu , the more modern Reserve Bank of South Africa  and the Telkom Lukasrand Tower. Other well-known structures and buildings include the Loftus Versfeld Stadium, The South African State Theatre and the Oliver Tambo building which is the Headquarters of the Department of International Relations and Cooperation.",

        "Concentration camp personnel  A freed Buchenwald concentration camp prisoner identifies a member of the SS camp guard From the SS-TV inception, Eicke fostered an attitude of \"inflexible harshness\" exercised by the masters. This core belief continued to influence SS guards in all concentration camps even after Eicke had taken over command of the SS Totenkopf Division. Recruits were taught to hate their enemies through tough training regimes and Nazi indoctrination. Within camps, guards subjugated the inmates in an atmosphere of controlled, disciplined cruelty. This environment of formalized brutality influenced some of the SS-TV's most infamous commandants including Rudolf Hoss, Franz Ziereis, Karl Otto Koch, Max Kogel, and Amon Goth. In the last days of World War II, a special group called the \"Auxiliary-SS\"  was formed as a last-ditch effort to keep concentration camps running and allow regular SS personnel to escape. Auxiliary-SS members were not considered regular SS personnel, but were conscripted members from other branches of the German military, the Nazi Party, and the Volkssturm. Such personnel wore a distinctive twin swastika collar patch and served as camp guard and administrative personnel until the surrender of Germany.",

        "Demographics The General Government was inhabited by 11.4\u00a0million people in December 1939. A year later the population increased to 12.1\u00a0million. In December 1940, 83.3% of the population were Poles, 11.2% Jews, 4.4% Ukrainians and Belarusians, 0.9% Germans, and 0.2% others. About 860,000 Poles and Jews were resettled into the General Government after they have been expelled from the territories 'annexed' by Nazi Germany. Offsetting this was the German genocidal campaign of liquidation of the Polish intelligentsia and other elements considered likely to resist. From 1941 disease and hunger also began to reduce the population. Poles were also deported in large numbers to work as forced labor in Germany: eventually about a million were deported, of whom many died in Germany. In 1940 the population was segregated into different groups. Each group had different rights, food rations, allowed strips in the cities, public transportation and restricted restaurants. They were divided from the most privileged, to the least.",

Since December 2019, it is part of the municipality Grammetal. On 1 December 2007, the former municipality Utzberg was incorporated by Nohra. Nohra was the location of the first Nazi concentration camp, established on March 3, 1933.  Prisoners were incarcerated in a school building. The former Luftwaffe airbase at Nohra was used by the Soviet Army for helicopter operations from 1945 until their withdrawal in 1992. The airfield had a short runway, a hangar and a radio beacon. Subsequently, the department for regional development largely demolished the complex, but a few elements were preserved because of their historic value, including a large stone statue of Lenin which was restored.",

After the German Invasion of Poland on 1 September 1939 started the Second World War, Warsaw was defended until 27 September. Central Poland, including Warsaw, came under the rule of the General Government, a German Nazi colonial administration. All higher education institutions were immediately closed and Warsaw's entire Jewish population \u2013 several hundred thousand, some 30% of the city\u00a0\u2013 were herded into the Warsaw Ghetto. In July on 1942, the Jews of the Warsaw Ghetto began to be deported en masse to the Aktion Reinhard extermination camps, particularly Treblinka. The city would become the centre of urban resistance to Nazi rule in occupied Europe. When the order came to annihilate the ghetto as part of Hitler's \"Final Solution\" on 19 April 1943, Jewish fighters launched the Warsaw Ghetto uprising. Despite being heavily outgunned and outnumbered, the Ghetto held out for almost a month. When the fighting ended, almost all survivors were massacred, with only a few managing to escape or hide.",

The Nazi Organisation Todt  operated each subcamp and used forced labour to build fortifications in Alderney including bunkers, gun emplacements, air raid shelters, tunnels and concrete fortifications. The camps commenced operating in January 1942. They were named after the Frisian Islands. The four camps on the island had a total inmate population that fluctuated but is estimated at about 6,000. Exact details are impossible to determine as many records were destroyed.",

The Luftwaffe killed 6,000 to 7,000 Polish civilians during the bombing of Warsaw. The German invasion saw atrocities committed against Polish men, women and children. The German forces  murdered tens of thousands of Polish civilians  and committing atrocities in numerous Polish towns, including massacres in Blonie, Zloczew, Boleslawiec, Torzeniec, Goworowo, Mlawa and Wloclawek). During Operation Tannenberg, a campaign of ethnic cleansing organized by multiple elements of the German government, tens of thousands of Polish civilians were shot at 760 mass execution sites by the Einsatzgruppen. Altogether, the civilian losses of Polish population amounted to about 150,000 to 200,000. Roughly 1,250 German civilians were also killed during the invasion.",

The following description is based on the badge coding system used before and during the early stages of the war in the Dachau concentration camp, which had one of the more elaborate coding systems. Shape was chosen by analogy with the common triangular road hazard signs in Germany that denote warnings to motorists. Here, a triangle is called inverted because its base is up while one of its angles points down.",

Werner Forssmann received his 1956 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his 1929 experiments with cardiac catheterization performed on his own heart, whilst resident in Eberswalde. In the 1938 pogroms, Eberswalde's synagogue was destroyed. During World War II, several factories employed forced labourers and inmates of the Ravensbruck concentration camp. At the end of the war, the town center was attacked by the German Luftwaffe, in an attempt to delay the Soviet advance. After learning that Soviet forces have taken Eberswalde without a fight, Adolf Hitler admitted defeat in his underground bunker and stated that suicide is his only recourse. In 1970 Eberswalde was merged with the settlement of Finow to create Eberswalde-Finow. In 1993 the name Eberswalde was restored.",

He cared for nearly 100 male Poles who had been sterilized at Birkenau by surgical operations. According to the witness, members of the group were later castrated by camp doctors.

As a result of the decisions of the Anti-fascist Council of national liberation of Yugoslavia  in Jajce on 21 November 1943 and on 21 November 1944 in Belgrade all legal rights and citizenship were collectively canceled for about 168,000 civilian members of the Danube Swabian minority who remained in Yugoslavia  after military defeat of the German army. Furthermore, they were fully dispossessed of all property. About 7,000 German-speaking citizens were killed by the local Yugoslav partisans in the autumn of 1944. Most of the other Danube Swabian civilians were interned and driven into numerous labor camps and at least eight additional prison camps were built for those who were unable to work: the old, the sick, and children under the age of 14 and mothers with small children under the age of 2 or 3.

        "Republic of Natalia Main article: Battle of Congella The Voortrekkers established the Republic of Natalia in 1839, with its capital at Pietermaritzburg. Tension between the Voortrekkers and the Zulus prompted the governor of the Cape Colony to dispatch a force under Captain Charlton Smith to establish British rule in Natal, for fear of losing British control in Port Natal. The force arrived on 4 May 1842 and built a fortification that was later to be The Old Fort. On the night of 23/24 May 1842 the British attacked the Voortrekker camp at Congella. The attack failed, and the British had to withdraw to their camp which was put under siege. A local trader Dick King and his servant Ndongeni were able to escape the blockade and rode to Grahamstown, a distance of 600\u00a0km  in fourteen days to raise reinforcements. The reinforcements arrived in Durban 20 days later; the Voortrekkers retreated, and the siege was lifted. Fierce conflict with the Zulu population led to the evacuation of Durban, and eventually the Afrikaners accepted British annexation in 1844 under military pressure.",

His mother, Yochevet, owned an import and export grocery business. His father, Israel, owned several businesses throughout eastern Poland, including several flour mills in Eastern Poland and wholesale liquor and gasoline businesses. Lerman and his family fled to the city of Lwow following the Nazi invasion of Poland in 1939. In 1941 Lerman was captured and sent to the Vinniki forced labor camp. However, he managed to escape the camp. He spent the next 23 months as a Jewish resistance fighter hidden in the forests surrounding Lwow. He went to the Polish city of Lodz following the end of the war. There he met his wife, Krysia Rozalia Laks, whom he married in a Displaced Persons camp. The couple emigrated together to the United States in 1947. Lerman arrived in New York City in 1947 before moving to Vineland, New Jersey, in 1948. Lerman purchased a poultry farm in Vineland.

        "Proclamation of the German Empire Further information: Proclamation of the German Empire The humiliating capture of the French emperor and the loss of the French army itself, which marched into captivity at a makeshift camp in the Saarland , threw the French government into turmoil; Napoleon's energetic opponents overthrew his government and proclaimed the Third Republic. The German High Command expected an overture of peace from the French, but the new republic refused to surrender. The Prussian army invested Paris and held it under siege until mid-January, with the city being \"ineffectually bombarded\". On 18 January 1871, the German princes and senior military commanders proclaimed Wilhelm \"German Emperor\" in the Hall of Mirrors at the Palace of Versailles. Under the subsequent Treaty of Frankfurt, France relinquished most of its traditionally German regions ; paid an indemnity, calculated  as the precise equivalent of the indemnity that Napoleon Bonaparte imposed on Prussia in 1807; and accepted German administration of Paris and most of northern France, with \"German troops to be withdrawn stage by stage with each installment of the indemnity payment\".",

        "Greece Further information: Axis occupation of Greece during World War II \u00a7\u00a0The Holocaust in Greece The Jews of Greece mainly lived in the area around Thessaloniki, where a large and influential Sephardi community had lived since the 15th century, where some 55,000 Jews comprised nearly 20% of the city. Following the German invasion and occupation of Salonika in 1941, an antisemitic nationalist party called National Union of Greece , which had existed between 1927 and 1935, was revived by Nazi authorities. The Greek governor, Vasilis Simonides, cooperated with the Nazi authorities and supplied local police forces to aide in deporting 48,500 Jews from Salonika to Auschwitz-Birkenau during March to August 1943. Both Greeks and Germans looted the businesses and homes vacated by the expelled Jews. Greek Jews residing in the areas occupied by Bulgaria were also deported following the deportations from Salonika. In March 1944, German forces and Greek police in Athens rounded-up Jews and deported them. Upwards of 2,000 Jews from Corfu and another 2,200 from Rhodes were transported to concentration camps in June 1944. Before the end of the war, over 60,000 Greek Jews were murdered, the vast majority of whom were sent to Auschwitz.",

        "Surrender According to Harold Marcuse, an American professor of German history, the camp commander, SS-Hauptsturmfuhrer Martin Weiss, together with the camp guards and the SS garrisons, had fled the camp before the arrival of U.S. troops. SS-Untersturmfuhrer Heinrich Wicker  was left in charge and had roughly 560 personnel at his disposal; these came from conscripted inmates of the SS disciplinary prison inside the Dachau concentration camp and Hungarian Waffen-SS troops. On April 29, Dachau was surrendered to Brigadier General Henning Linden of the 42nd Infantry Division of the U.S. Army by Untersturmfuhrer Wicker. According to Linden, he arrived at the command post in Dachau at about 15:00 and proceeded to make his way across the Amper River to the site of the complex approximately one-half kilometre south of the bridge he crossed. He proceeded to take control of the camp in some tumult; thereafter, he toured the camp with a group of reporters . A description of the surrender appears in Brig. Gen. Henning Linden's memorandum to Maj. Gen. Harry J. Collins, entitled Report on Surrender of Dachau Concentration Camp:",

During German invasion of France, Golebiewski, then already a sergeant, fought in Alsace and Lorraine. On June 21, 1940 he was captured by the Germans and was sent to a POW camp in Sarreguemines, from where he escaped on the night of October 4/5, 1940. Across France, Spain and Gibraltar Golebiewski reached England on July 13, 1941. Soon afterwards he began a Cichociemni training.",

        "Number of victims  A monument commemorating the victims of the Sajmi\u0161te concentration camp Of the Jewish population of 16,000 in Serbia Proper, the Nazis murdered approximately 14,500. According to Jelena Subotic, of the 33,500 Jews who lived in Serbia pre-occupation, around 27,000 were killed in the Holocaust. In German-occupied Serbia approximately 12,000 of the 17,000 Jews were killed very early into the war, including almost all 11,000 Belgrade Jews. According to Yugoslav experts and post-war reports by Yugoslav government commissions, almost all Jews from Serbia, including the Banat, appeared to have been killed. Those Jews who joined the Partisans survived as well as Jewish members of the Royal Yugoslav Army captured in the invasion who ended up in Germany as prisoners of war. This means that the number of murdered Jews is around 16,000 while Romano in his latest estimates reduced that number to 15,000 killed.",

        "Aftermath At least 30,000 inmates died in Sachsenhausen from causes such as exhaustion, disease, malnutrition and pneumonia, as a result of the poor living conditions. Many were executed or died as the result of brutal medical experimentation. Over the course of its operation, over 100 Dutch resistance fighters were executed at Sachsenhausen. Dutch Freemasons were also sent to the camp including the Grand Master of the Grand Orient of the Netherlands, Hermannus Van Torgeren, who died there in March 1940, after being arrested by Klaus Barbie. The Dutch subsequently sought the extradition from Czechoslovakia of Antonin Zapotocky, who became President of Czechoslovakia, for his alleged role in the murder of Dutch prisoners during his time as a kapo at the camp. According to an article published on 13 December 2001 in The New York Times, \"In the early years of the war the SS practiced methods of mass killing there that were later used in the Nazi death camps. Of the roughly 30,000 wartime victims at Sachsenhausen, most were Russian prisoners of war\".",

The more limited and dispersed Polish armoured units were quickly destroyed. The Red Army, invading the east of Poland, also deployed armoured divisions. At the time, the swift collapse of the Polish army was seen as the result of an armoured Blitzkrieg. However, later it has been argued that the campaign was largely an instance of the classical nineteenth century German concept of the \"Annihilation Battle\", in which the role of deep strategic armoured penetrations was limited.",

This labour was made available by the German army Etappenkommando for use by private companies throughout the Luderitz area, working on infrastructure projects such as railway construction, the building of the harbour, and flattening and levelling Shark Island through the use of explosives. This highly dangerous and physical work inevitably led to large-scale sickness and death amongst the prisoners, with one German technician complaining that the 1,600-strong Nama work force had shrunk to a strength of only 30\u201340 available for work due to 7\u20138 deaths occurring daily by late 1906.
