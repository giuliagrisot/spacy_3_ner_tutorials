        "History Main article: Rock art of the Djelfa region The area is notable for its abundance of Neolithic rock carvings dating from 7000 to 5000 BC. North of Djelfa town there is an imposing physical feature known as Rocher de Sel  that resulted from the erosion of rock salts and marls by rain. To the west of the town Megalithic funerary structures are found. During the Roman Empire a Roman town called Fallaba was built on the site of Djelfa. That town lasted unto late antiquity. In the 11th century, the Fatimids sent the Banu Hilal to the Tripolitania, Tunisia and Constantine areas against the Zirids. During Philippe Petain's period, a concentration camp was placed in Djelfa.",

        "Other events The destruction of the Sephardi Il Kal Grande synagogue in Sarajevo was carried out by Nazi German soldiers and their local Usta\u0161e allies soon after their arrival in the city on 15 April. The Sarajevo Haggadah was the most important artifact which survived this period, smuggled out of Sarajevo and saved from the Nazis and Usta\u0161e by the chief librarian of the National Museum, Dervi\u0161 Korkut. The demolition of the Zagreb Synagogue was ordered by the Usta\u0161e mayor Ivan Werner and was carried out from 10 October 1941 to April 1942. The two Jewish football clubs in the state, \u017dGi\u0160K Makabi Zagreb and \u017d\u0160K Makabi Osijek, were banned in 1941. In April 1942, the Jews of Osijek were forced to build a \"Jewish settlement\" at Tenja, into which they were herded along with Jews from the surrounding region. Approximately 3,000 Jews were moved to Tenja in June and July 1942. From Tenja, 200 Jews were transported to the Jasenovac concentration camp and 2,800 Jews were transported to the Auschwitz concentration camp. In February 1942 the Usta\u0161e Interior Minister, Andrija Artukovic, in a speech to the Croatian Parliament declared that:",

In his 1936 essay \"Wotan\" Swiss psychologist Carl Jung speaks of Ergriffenheit, explained in the English version as \"a state of being seized or possessed\", and characterizes Germany as \"infected... rolling towards perdition\". However, Jung sees the German Faith Movement as \"decent and well-meaning people who honestly admit their Ergriffenheit and try to come to terms with this new and undeniable fact.\" He commends Hauer's book Deutsche Gottschau as an attempt \"to build a bridge between the dark forces of life and the shining world of historical ideas\". The movement had around 200,000 followers at its height . Following the Nazi accession to power, it obtained rights of civil tolerance from Rudolf Hess, but never the preferential treatment from the Nazi state for which Hauer campaigned. However, in the years that followed Hauer's abdication of his  title, the Movement largely served as a NSDAP appendage. The development of the German Faith Movement revolved around:",

These were deportees from the Altreich as well as from Reichsgau Danzig-West Prussia, Reichsgau Wartheland, and South East Prussia. The Lipowa camp remained in place after the Lublin reservation was abandoned. After January 1941, the Lublin Jews who earlier had resided outside the camp, were forced to live in the camp after its expansion. Also in 1941, the camp was officially made part of the SS enterprise Deutsche Ausrustungswerke . Effectively it remained outside DAW control by staying under the direct aegis of Globo\u010dnik. This changed only in 1943, after Globo\u010dnik resigned as the Lublin district SS-and-Police Leader and the camp became the sub-camp of Majdanek concentration camp complex.",

        "Background During the early campaigns of 1914, the Belgian army had been pushed out of the fortified cities of Liege, Namur and Antwerp by the German advance. Although they succeeded in delaying the Germans at some actions, they were forced to withdraw, first to Antwerp, and into the far north-west of Belgium. By October 1914, the Belgian forces were holding a position along the Yser and Ieperlee canal. After months of retreat, the Belgian forces were considerably reduced and were exhausted. They flooded a large expanse of territory in front of their lines, stretching as far south as Diksmuide. Between 16 and 31 October 1914, the Belgians held off the German army at the Battle of the Yser, suffering 3,500 killed and 15,000 wounded.  The Battle of the Yser established a front line which would endure until 1918.",

The British Museum Though not officially sanctioned, legal beheadings were carried out against at least 50 prostitutes and pimps under Saddam Hussein as late as 2000. Beheadings have emerged as another terror tactic especially in Iraq since 2003. Civilians have borne the brunt of the beheadings, although U.S. and Iraqi military personnel have also been targeted. After kidnapping the victim, the kidnappers typically make some sort of demand of the government of the hostage's nation and give a time limit for the demand to be carried out, often 72 hours. Beheading is often threatened if the government fails to heed the wishes of the hostage takers. Sometimes, the beheadings are videotaped and made available on the Internet.  One of the most publicized of such executions was that of Nick Berg. Judicial execution is practiced in Iraq, but is generally carried out by hanging.",

During the Wannsee Conference, Reinhard Heydrich, chief of the Reich Main Security Office, had outlined to several leading Nazis, in somewhat coded language, the German government's plan to enact the Final Solution. In August 1966 Wulf co-founded, with Friedrich Zipfel and Peter Heilmann, the International Document Center Organization for the Study of National Socialism and Its Aftermath, and began campaigning to have it housed in the Wannsee Conference villa. Wulf abandoned his efforts in 1971. The German government was not interested in moving forward with the idea at that time. The building was in use as a school, and funding was not available. The issue of the memorial was so politically sensitive in Germany that Wulf apparently needed police protection because of threats. Klaus Schutz, then mayor of West Berlin, said he did not want any \"macabre cult site\".",

With \"courage and skill\", documenting \"cruelty which goes beyond all words ... for future generations\", after his liberation at the end of World War II, Brasse \"could not continue with his profession\" and would never take another photograph.

After his release Hundhammer entered a shattered professional and economical existence.

This workshop became a point of contact for former members of the BVP as well as current members of the Munich Catholic circle before being closed by the Gestapo in November 1937. Hundhammer avoided confrontation with the Nazis throughout the remainder of the Nazi-Era out of consideration for his family, which consisted of his wife and four sons by 1941.

Aly has made much of documents from the bureaucracy of the German Government-General of Poland arguing that the population of ] would have to decrease by 25% to allow the Polish economy to grow. Criticism centers on the idea that this explanation does not really show why the Nazis would deport Jews from ] and the ] to death camps in Poland if it was Poland the Nazis were concerned with, and why the Jews of Poland were targeted instead of the random sample of 25% of the Polish population.  Additional criticism of functionalism points out that Hitler and other Nazi leaders delayed railcars providing supplies to front line troops in the Soviet Union so that Jews could be deported by rail from the USSR to death camps thus demonstrating the pursuit of genocidal policies over pragmatic wartime actions.{{Citation needed|reason=This claim needs a reliable source|date=March 2018}}",

Romanies were marked for extermination and sentenced to forced labor and imprisonment in concentration camps. They were often killed on sight, especially by the Einsatzgruppen  on the Eastern Front. The total number of victims has been variously estimated at between 220,000 and 1,500,000. The treatment of the Romani in Nazi puppet states differed markedly.

        "Comic books While at Gurs, Rosenthal created three short comic books in French, Mickey au Camp de Gurs , La Journee d'un Heberge , and Petit Guide a travers le Camp de Gurs . He used ink and watercolour on A5 paper to write and illustrate the books. Mickey au Camp de Gurs is a 13-panel comic strip starring Walt Disney's Mickey Mouse, who is arrested on suspicion of being Jewish and sent to Gurs. La Journee d'un Heberge is 18 pages long and describes a typical day in the camp, including the forced marches, interrogations, substandard food, and romance with a female inmate. Petit Guide a travers le Camp de Gurs is a 13-page tongue-in-cheek guide to the camp facilities and its daily events.",

The weather was not suitable for flying that morning, which disadvantaged the Allies. The SS Division Das Reich recaptured Mortain, and an armored battle group under Joachim Peiper reached Bourlopin, but had to halt due to US counterattacks and air strikes. The much-reduced division was encircled in the Falaise pocket by US, Canadian, and Polish forces. Some LSSAH units broke out of the pocket on 22 August, leaving behind all their tanks and artillery. The division sustained 5,000 casualties during the Normandy campaign.

Many men, some the very young and old, were killed resisting or trying to escape. Once collected, they would be roped or chained together and marched, with little food or water, long distances to camp.

The mass killing facilities were developed at about the same time inside the Auschwitz II-Birkenau subcamp of a forced labour complex, and at the Majdanek concentration camp. In most other camps prisoners were selected for slave labor first; they were kept alive on starvation rations and made available to work as required. Auschwitz, Majdanek, and Jasenovac were retrofitted with Zyklon-B gas chambers and crematoria buildings as the time went on, remaining operational until war's end in 1945.",

His parents, Henri and Rosa Mandel, were Jewish emigres from Poland, the former a member of Rosa Luxemburg's and Karl Liebknecht's Spartacist League. The beginning of Mandel's period at university was interrupted when the German occupying forces closed the university. During World War II, he twice escaped after being arrested in the course of resistance activities, and survived imprisonment in the German concentration camp at Dora. After the war, he became a leader of the Belgian Trotskyists and the youngest member of the Fourth International secretariat, alongside Michel Pablo and others. He gained respect as a prolific journalist with a clear and lively style, as an orthodox Marxist theoretician, and as a talented debater. He wrote for numerous media outlets in the 1940s and 1950s including Het Parool, Le Peuple, l'Observateur and Agence France-Presse. At the height of the Cold War, he publicly defended the merits of Marxism in debates with the social democrat and future Dutch premier Joop den Uyl.",

Bleicher's position enabled him to ensure than the most needy detainees were given the clothes of those who had died, and he increasingly earned respect among fellow prisoners whom he organised with skill and compassion, supporting those who collapsed from the intensity of the physical work, thereby often rescuing these from certain death.   His time at Buchenwald marked him deeply for the rest of his life.   It also changed his personal future.

Hoss's testimony did not consist of merely a signed confession; while in jail he also wrote two volumes of memoirs and gave extensive testimony outside of the Nuremberg proceedings. Further, his testimony agrees with that of other contemporary written accounts by Auschwitz officials, such as Pery Broad, an SS man stationed at Auschwitz while Hoss was the commandant and the diary kept by SS physician at Auschwitz Johann Kremer, as well as the testimony of hundreds of camp guards and victims. In addition, former SS personnel have criticised Holocaust denial. SS-Oberscharfuhrer Josef Klehr said that anyone who maintains that nobody was gassed at Auschwitz must be \"crazy or on the wrong\". SS-Unterscharfuhrer Oswald Kaduk stated that he did not consider those who maintain such a thing as normal people. Hearing about Holocaust denial compelled former SS-Rottenfuhrer Oskar Groning to publicly speak about what he witnessed at Auschwitz, and denounce Holocaust deniers, stating:",

The British and French armies dismounted many of their cavalry regiments and used them in infantry and other roles: the Life Guards for example spent the last months of the War as a machine gun corps; and the Australian Light Horse served as light infantry during the Gallipoli campaign. In September 1914 cavalry comprised 9.28% of the total manpower of the British Expeditionary Force in France\u2014by July 1918 this proportion had fallen to 1.65%. As early as the first winter of the war most French cavalry regiments had dismounted a squadron each, for service in the trenches. The French cavalry numbered 102,000 in May 1915 but had been reduced to 63,000 by October 1918. The German Army dismounted nearly all their cavalry in the West, maintaining only one mounted division on that front by January 1917.",

Neville, who hoped to \"breed out\" Aboriginal characteristics from the growing \"half caste\" population of Aborigines in Western Australia.  As a result, he failed to prosecute cases where half caste girls were sexually abused or raped by European Australians, who sought an evening on \"the black velvet\".  The children of such unions were often taken from their mothers and confined to \"concentration camps\" at Moore River and Carrolup, as a part of the policy known as Stolen Generations. The desire to avoid miscegenation was also a factor in the passage and continued enforcement of the White Australia policy. In 1949, Immigration Minister Arthur Calwell stated \"I am sure we don't want half-castes running over our country\", while justifying the government's decision to refuse entry to Lorenzo Gamboa .",

        "Giving of family names Main article: Latvian name While there are records of Latvian last names going as far back as 15th century, almost all of them were inhabitants of large cities and often adopted Germanic family names. Some peasants had family names in the 17th century, but majority had only first name until the emancipation. Most people were identified by the name of their house or manor. Emancipation created the need for identity papers and with this, for family names. Livonian peasants had to choose family names by 1826, in Courland majority names were selected in the campaign that lasted from October 1834 until July 1835. Peasants were prohibited from choosing family names of German nobility and majority chose names related to animals, plants and trees, especially popular were diminutive forms \u2013 B\u0113rzs , B\u0113rzi\u0146\u0161 , Kalns , Kalni\u0146\u0161 .",

The name is variously translated as Institute of Sex Research, Institute of Sexology, Institute for Sexology or Institute for the Science of Sexuality. The Institute was a non-profit foundation situated in Tiergarten, Berlin. It was headed by Magnus Hirschfeld. Since 1897 he had run the Wissenschaftlich-humanitares Komitee , which campaigned on progressive and rational grounds for LGBT rights and tolerance. The Committee published the long-running journal Jahrbuch fur sexuelle Zwischenstufen. Hirschfeld built a unique library on same-sex love and eroticism. The Nazi book burnings in Berlin included the archives of the Institute. After the Nazis gained control of Germany in the 1930s, the institute and its libraries were destroyed as part of a Nazi government censorship program by youth brigades, who burned its books and documents in the street.",

He had studied architecture at the Armour Institute of Technology, which is now known at the Illinois Institute of Technology.  He was an architect who designed the Community Center building for the South Side Hebrew Congregation at the corner of 73rd and Chappel on the south side of Chicago.  He also worked at the American Ideal Cleaning Co., his family's cleaning business. In 1965, Kohn had developed a nervous tick and when his doctor told him to find a hobby to alleviate his stress, he began collecting stamps. However, Kohn's interest in Holocaust memorabilia grew when he saw that his uncle Adolph's name was on a partial list of victims cremated at Theresienstadt concentration camp on July 5, 1943. Kohn's wife Janet died in 1988. They had two sons, Kerry and Lester, and a daughter, Judith.",

And finally, in 2005 additional archeological works were conducted, resulting in new items being unearthed at the camp site, buried by Jewish prisoners in 1943. On September 2, 2009 the Majdanek Museum was awarded the Gold Medal Gloria Artis for outstanding contributions to Polish culture by Deputy State Secretary Minister Tomasz Merta. Two other recipients included the Muzeum Stutthof and the Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum. There was a massive fire at one of the barracks in Majdanek on the night of August 9/10, 2010. Some 7,000 pairs of prisoners' shoes were destroyed \u2013 stated the museum administration. The cause of the blaze is unknown.

Eicke became the chief inspector for all concentration camps, responsible for organizing others according to his model. The Dachau complex included the prisoners' camp which occupied approximately 5 acres, and the much larger area of SS training school including barracks, factories plus other facilities of around 20 acres. The entrance gate used by prisoners carries the phrase \"Arbeit macht frei\"  free\"; contextual English translation: \"Work shall set you free\").

        "Significance German historian Karin Orth wrote that there was hardly a measure so perfidious as the SS attempt to delegate the implementation of terror and violence to the victims themselves. Eugen Kogon, an avowed opponent of Nazism from prewar Germany and Buchenwald concentration camp survivor, wrote after the war ended that the concentration camp system owed its stability in no small way to a cadre of kapos, who took over the daily operations of the camp, thus relieving the SS personnel. The absolute power was ubiquitous. The system of discipline and supervision would have promptly disintegrated, according to Kogon, without the delegation of power downwards. The rivalry over supervisory and warehouse functionary jobs was, for the SS, an opportunity to pit prisoners against each other.  Thus, the regular prisoner was at the mercy of a dual authority, the SS, who often hardly seemed to be at the camp, and the prisoner kapos, who were always there. The term kapo is used as a slur in the twenty-first century.",

        "History  Pelplin Cathedral, cathedral of the former monastery of the Cistercians  Archaeological findings have revealed that human  settlements existed  in the region of the town already during the Stone Age  and the  Bronze Age. The history of Pelplin is tightly interwoven with the history of  the Monastery of Pelplin, which according to the monastery's chronicle was founded in 1274 by Mestwin II, Duke of Pomerania. The monastery of Pelplin had a forerunner in the monastery of the Cistercians in Pogutken located at the upper course of the Wierzyca, which had been founded in 1258 by Sambor II, Duke of Pomerania. In 1276 the monks, which had come from the Monastery of Doberan in Mecklenburg to Pogutken, begun to transfer their monastery to Pelplin. From Pelplin, the German monks organized an extensive settlement campaign. They brought in dispossessed farmers and craftsmen and founded a number of German villages in the area. The initiative came from Duke Sambor II, who wanted to compensate population losses of the past, which had occurred because of wars with Pomeralia's neighbours, the Kingdom of Poland in the south and the Old Prussians in the east. During the 12th century, Polish dukes gained control over Pomeralia.",

Trial location, 2012 photo.ProceedingsStart date18 August 1963Case decided21 January 1965 The Belzec trial  in the mid-1960s was a war crimes trial of eight former SS members of Belzec extermination camp. The trial was held at the 1st Munich District Court  and should be seen in the context of the Sobibor trial, which followed the Belzec trial, because five of the defendants were accused in both trials. In addition, the Belzec and Sobibor trials, along with the Treblinka trials, form a body of evidence of the crimes of mass extermination as part of the so-called Action Reinhardt programme - the killing of over two million Jews and 50,000 Roma and Sinti. These trials are directly related to the mass murder of 100,000 people in the official Nazi Euthanasia programme known after the war as Action T4, as many of the security guards worked in the euthanasia centres before transferring to the extermination camps. The first Euthanasia trials were carried out shortly after the war.",

Many Czech people were waiting for political changes in monarchy, including Toma\u0161 Garrigue Masaryk and others. Masaryk served in the Reichsrat  from 1891 to 1893 in the Young Czech Party and again from 1907 to 1914 in the Realist Party , but he did not campaign for the independence of Czechs and Slovaks from Austria-Hungary. In Vienna in 1909 he helped Hinko Hinkovic's defense in the fabricated trial against prominent Croats and Serbs members of the Serbo-Croatian Coalition , and others, who were sentenced to more than 150 years and a number of death penalties.

        "Political and religious opponents Main articles: German resistance to Nazism, Religion in Nazi Germany, and Persecution of Jehovah's Witnesses in Nazi Germany German communists, socialists and trade unionists were among the earliest opponents of the Nazis and among the first to be sent to concentration camps. Nacht und Nebel , a directive issued by Hitler on 7 December 1941, resulted in the disappearance,  torture and death of political activists throughout German-occupied Europe; the courts had sentenced 1,793 people to death by April 1944, according to Jack Fischel. Because they refused to pledge allegiance to the Nazi party or serve in the military, Jehovah's Witnesses were sent to concentration camps, where they were identified by purple triangles and given the option of renouncing their faith and submitting to the state's authority. The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum estimates that between 2,700 and 3,300 were sent to the camps, where 1,400 died. According to German historian Detlef Garbe, \"no other religious movement resisted the pressure to conform to National Socialism with comparable unanimity and steadfastness.\"",

Naturally many of the people shared the belief that now they really would be brought to another camp, where conditions would be much better. On his personal story, Carlebach said \"without a positive attitude no one had any chance of survival.\" 450 inmates were held back and formed into a work commando. They were intended to be used to disguise the camp remnants as a farm. This work commando existed for one year. The survivors were then sent to the Riga ghetto, which existed until November 1943. Of the approximately 4,000 people transported to Jungfernhof, only 148 persons survived.",

Holocaust deniers claim that the extermination camps were actually transit camps from which Jews were deported farther east. However, these theories are disproven by surviving German documents, which show that Jews were sent to the camps to be killed. Extermination camp research is difficult because of extensive attempts by the SS and Nazi regime to conceal the existence of the extermination camps.

        "Operation Reinhardt Main article: Operation Reinhard Born in Annahof in the former Upper Silesia region of the German Empire . Thomalla became a member of the Nazi Party in 1932:  and SS . The first death camp to be constructed under Thomalla's supervision was Belzec. Construction started on 1 November 1941 and was completed in March 1942. He then proceeded to design and supervise the construction of Sobibor in March 1942.  Workers employed for building the camp were local people from neighboring villages and towns.  These workers consisted of about eighty Jews from ghettos within the vicinity of the camp.  A squad of ten watchmen trained at Trawniki concentration camp guarded these workers.  Upon completion of the camp, these Jews were shot.  When Thomalla completed his building assignment in Sobibor he was replaced there as commandant by Franz Stangl in April 1942. He then proceeded to Treblinka which copied the design of Sobibor. SS commander Erwin Lambert who had previously been assigned to the Action T4 euthanasia program and had constructed the new gas chambers in Treblinka, testified about Thomalla:",

        "Dismissal and capture On 13 September 1944, Goth was relieved of his position and charged by the SS with theft of Jewish property , failure to provide adequate food to the prisoners under his charge, violation of concentration camp regulations regarding the treatment and punishment of prisoners, and allowing unauthorised access to camp personnel records by prisoners and non-commissioned officers. Administration of the camp at Plaszow was turned over to SS-Obersturmfuhrer Arnold Buscher. The camp was closed on 15 January 1945. Goth was scheduled for an appearance before SS judge Georg Konrad Morgen, but due to the progress of World War II and Germany's looming defeat, the charges against him were dropped in early 1945. SS doctors diagnosed Goth as suffering from mental illness, and he was committed to a mental institution in Bad Tolz, where he was arrested by the United States military in May 1945. He was arrested wearing a Wehrmacht uniform, and did not admit to being an SS officer. He was sent to a temporary prison camp located on the grounds of the former Dachau concentration camp. He was later identified by former inmates of the Krakow-Plaszow concentration camp, including Josef Levkovich.",

        "Distinctive features Genocidal state Further information: List of Nazi concentration camps German-occupied Europe, 1942Concentration camps, extermination camps, and ghettos  The logistics of the mass murder turned Germany into what Michael Berenbaum called a \"genocidal state\". Eberhard Jackel wrote in 1986 during the German Historikerstreit\u2014a dispute among historians about the uniqueness of the Holocaust and its relationship with the crimes of the Soviet Union\u2014that it was the first time a state had thrown its power behind the idea that an entire people should be wiped out. Anyone with three or four Jewish grandparents was to be exterminated, and complex rules were devised to deal with Mischlinge . Bureaucrats identified who was a Jew, confiscated property, and scheduled trains to deport them. Companies fired Jews and later used them as slave labor. Universities dismissed Jewish faculty and students. German pharmaceutical companies tested drugs on camp prisoners; other companies built the crematoria. As prisoners entered the death camps, they surrendered all personal property, which was cataloged and tagged before being sent to Germany for reuse or recycling. Through a concealed account, the German National Bank helped launder valuables stolen from the victims.",

On 19 May 1947, the former head of the Mittelwerk facility, Georg Rickhey, was extradited to Germany from Wright Field in the U.S. and acquitted of war crimes at the Dora Trial.  Arthur Rudolph, after immigrating to the U.S. and playing key roles in the Pershing missile and Apollo programs, was forced to renounce his U.S. citizenship and return to Germany; the West German government, citing the statute of limitations, never charged him and eventually granted him citizenship. Wernher von Braun, the Technical Director of a separate facility at Peenemunde Army Research Center, visited the Mittelwerk on 25 January 1944, and a 1991 author alleged he witnessed Mittelwerk and Buchenwald war crimes.",

        "Trial in Poland After the war in 1945, Munch was arrested in a US internment camp after being identified as an Auschwitz physician. He was extradited to Poland in 1946 to stand trial in Krakow. He was specifically accused of injecting inmates with malaria-infected blood, and with a serum that caused rheumatism; however, many former prisoners testified in support of Munch in their witness speeches. The court acquitted him on 22 December 1947, \"not only because he did not commit any crime of harm against the camp prisoners, but because he had a benevolent attitude toward them and helped them, while he had to carry the responsibility. He did this independently from the nationality, race-and-religious origin and political conviction of the prisoners.\" The court's acquittal was based, among other things, on his strict refusal to participate in the selections. Of the 40 Auschwitz staff tried in Krakow at the Auschwitz Trial, only Munch was acquitted. He was called the \"Good Man of Auschwitz\", who had saved prisoners from death in the gas chambers.",

At that time, the Romanians were moving too fast for the German bureaucracy.\" .",

Several Polish families were deported deep into the USSR, and the occupation administration was co-created by local Jews. From June 1941 to July 1944 it was occupied by Nazi Germany. In 1941, the Germans deported 99 local Jews to the ghettos in Augustow and Grodno, from where they were later transported to the Treblinka extermination camp. On July 13, 1943, the Germans murdered 50 Poles from Lipsk in nearby Naumowicze. Among those killed was Marianna Biernacka, one of the 108 Martyrs of World War II. In July 1944, Lipsk was captured by the Red Army, and murders and robberies followed, as well as the fight against the Polish Home Army resistance movement.

The 2nd division was kept in reserve and participated only in mopping-up operations. In this it was supported by the Kalin\u010diak group. The 3rd division had to protect 170\u00a0km of the Slovak border between Stara \u013dubov\u0148a and the border with Hungary. It fought minor skirmishes, and after several days moved into Polish territory, ending its advance on September 11.

The British \"Double Cross\" anti-espionage operation had proven very successful from the outset of the war, and the LCS was able to use double agents to send back misleading information about Allied invasion plans. The use of visual deception, including mock tanks and other military hardware had been developed during the North Africa campaign. Mock hardware was created for Bodyguard; in particular, dummy landing craft were stockpiled to give the impression that the invasion would take place near Calais. The Operation was a strategic success and the Normandy landings caught German defences unaware.

Only four days later, upon the inauguration of the section to Spi\u0161ska Nova Ves, it became a through station. With the commissioning of the first part of the Poprad-Tatry\u2013Plave\u010d railway in 1889, the station was transformed into a junction. The metre gauge connection with the High Tatras was achieved on 20 December 1908, via Stary Smokovec. On 25 March 1942, the first deportation of Slovak Jews left Poprad station for the Auschwitz death camp. The train that departed that day was carrying about 1,000 Jewish girls and young women. Most of the subsequent transports of Slovak Jews similarly departed from Poprad. By the end of 1942, when the transports were halted, over 58,000 Jews had been deported from Slovakia to Poland. Following a renovation in the 1980s, the station reached its present form as a two level interchange station. An SKK 858 million modernization and extension of the 1980s renovations was carried out in 2006\u20132007.",

        "History In 1940, the Nazis created a ghetto in Bobowa. In October 1941, a ghetto was established in the nearby town, Gorlice. Jews from this city and neighboring villages were all gathered there. Deportations to Belzec extermination camp and mass executions started in the spring of 1942. On August 14, 1942, Jews from Gorlice and Bobowa arrived in Strozowka. All these Jews, about 700 were shot on the so-called presbytery square and in the Garbacz forest near Strozowka. The selection of others took place near the road. Elderly and sick people were put aside. Young people were still useful.  The Jews were led to the pit by young Polish men from Baudienst whom the Nazis forced to drink alcohol and help them during the execution process.",

        "Holocaust resistance In the midst of the 1942 deportations, some Jews in Tarnow organized a Jewish resistance movement. Many of the resistance leaders were young Zionists involved in the Hashomer Hatzair youth movement. Many of those who left the ghetto to join the partisans fighting in the forests later fell in battle with SS units. Other resisters sought to establish escape routes to Hungary, but with limited success. The Germans decided to destroy the Tarnow ghetto in September 1943. The surviving 10,000 Jews were deported, 7,000 of them to Auschwitz and 3,000 to the Plaszow concentration camp in Krakow. In late 1943, Tarnow was declared \"free of Jews\" . By the end of the war, the overwhelming majority of Tarnow Jews had been murdered by the Germans. Although 700 Jews returned in 1945, some of them soon left the city. Many moved to Israel.",

        "Life Plotnicka was born in Plotnitsa, a village near Pinsk, during World War I, part of the newly reborn Poland since 1919 after a century of foreign Partitions. She relocated to Warsaw in 1938 to assume a position at the headquarters of the Dror Zionist Youth Movement founded on Polish lands in 1915 in the course of the war with imperial Russia. Following the 1939 invasion of Poland by Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union, Plotnicka undertook underground activities as leader of the HeHalutz youth movement. Using false identities and facial disguise, she travelled across General Government territory between Jewish ghettos in German-occupied Poland. She witnessed the Holocaust trains departing from train stations to undisclosed death camps during the extermination of the Jews known as the \"Final Solution\". As a courier , she delivered light weapons procured by the Warsaw Ghetto underground, as well as blueprints, drafted by the headquarters, for the manufacture of Molotov cocktails and hand grenades.  Among the Jewish communities she visited, Plotnicka was referred to as \"Die Mameh\", Yiddish for \"Mom\". She relayed the reports of murderous liquidation of so many ghettos that she began to call herself a \"gravedigger\".",

        "Second World War Battle of Greece On 28 October 1940, Italian forces invaded Greece following the refusal of the Greek dictator Ioannis Metaxas to accept the ultimatum given by the Italians. In the resulting Greco-Italian War and the subsequent German invasion, many of Thessaloniki's Jews took part. 12,898 men enlisted in the Greek army; 4,000 participated in the campaigns in Albania and Macedonia; 513 fought against the Germans and, in total, 613 Jews were killed, including 174 from Salonika. The 50th Brigade of Macedonia was nicknamed \"Cohen Battalion\", reflecting the preponderance of Jews in its composition. After the defeat of Greece, many Jewish soldiers suffered frostbite while returning home on foot.",

A wide street, which led to a large open area, was flanked by two rows of wooden barracks, on both sides stood rows of young trees and along the roadside ran straight flower beds as far as the eye could see. The square and the streets seemed freshly raked. To the left towards the watchtower, I saw a white wooden barrack and beside it a large cage, the size of a birdhouse the like you see at a zoo. Within it paraded peacocks  and on a climbing tree dangled monkeys and a parrot which always screamed the same word, \"Mama\". I wondered, \"this is  a concentration camp\"?

He was involved in the battle of Midtskogen, and was later in command of military forces in Osterdalen, Valdres and Northern Norway. He was among the pioneer leaders of the undercover military organisation Milorg, building up the Southern Norway district . He was arrested by the Germans in December 1942, tortured at Arkivet in Kristiansand, transferred to the Grini detention camp, sentenced to death and shot at Trandumskogen in May 1944. The crackdown of the Milorg district in Southern Norway by Gestapo in December 1942 led to the death of more than fifty men. Semb-Johansson estimates that 324 persons were arrested. Six of these were executed, including Laudal, while seventy died during imprisonment or shortly after the war. He was posthumously awarded the British King's Commendation for Brave Conduct. A bust of Laudal was unveiled in Kristiansand in 1969.",

One track branched off from the main line, the other ran over a turntable from the camp to a row of sheds some 250 meters away. A freight car happened to stand on the turntable. Several Jews were busy turning the disk. SS guards, rifles under their arms, stood by. One of the sheds was open; one could distinctly see that it was filled to the ceiling with bundles of clothes. As we went on, I looked back one more time. The fence was too high to see anything at all.<ref name=\"heart-cornides\"/>}}   In his typewritten pages, Cornides also summarized conversations with other Germans he met during his stopover in the ''Deutsches Haus'' at Rawa Ruska, as well as statements he remembered from Chelm upon his arrival there.",

        "Political activities Amongst other things, Beuys founded  the following political organisations: German Student Party , Organization for Direct Democracy Through Referendum , Free International University for Creativity and Interdisciplinary Research , and German Green Party Die Grunen . Beuys became a pacifist, was a vocal opponent of nuclear weapons and campaigned strenuously for environmental causes . Some of Beuys's art dealt explicitly with the issues at play in the political groups with which he was affiliated. His song and music video \"Sun Instead of Reagan!\"  manifests the theme of regeneration  that runs through his life and work as well as his interest in contemporary nuclear politics: \"But we want: sun instead of Reagan, to live without weapons!

This was based on a misunderstanding by some of the British volunteers after Parrington in the summer of 1943 had visited the POW \"holiday camp\" at Genshagen, in the southern suburbs of Berlin, as representative of the Senior British POW, Major General Victor Fortune. Parrington had told the assembled prisoners that he \"knew the purpose of the camp\" and the BFC volunteers who were there took this to mean that he approved of the unit. In reality, Parrington had accepted Genshagen at face value as a rest centre for POWs.",

Camps also existed in the Pyrenees on the border with pro-Nazi Spain, among them Camp de Rivesaltes, Camp Gurs and Camp Vernet. From these, the French cooperated in deporting about 73,000 Jews to Nazi Germany. In addition, in areas which Germany formally annexed from France, such as Alsace-Lorraine, concentration camps were built, the largest being Natzweiler-Struthof.

        "Client and occupied states British Client states Egypt Main article: Military history of Egypt during World War II The United Kingdom controlled Egypt and used it as a major base for Allied operations throughout the region, especially the battles in North Africa against Italy and Germany. Its highest priorities were control of the Eastern Mediterranean, and especially keeping the Suez Canal open for merchant ships and for military connections with India and Australia. The Kingdom of Egypt was nominally an independent state since 1922 but effectively remained in the British sphere of influence with the British Mediterranean fleet being stationed in Alexandria and British Army forces being stationed in the Suez Canal zone. Egypt faced an Axis campaign led by Italian and German forces during the war. British frustration over King Farouk's reign over Egypt resulted in the Abdeen Palace Incident of 1942 where British Army forces surrounded the royal Abdeen Palace and demanded a new government be established, nearly forcing the abdication of Farouk until he submitted to British demands. The Kingdom of Egypt joined the United Nations on 24 February 1945. India",

The Daimler-Benz company established the Ludwigsfelde factory in 1936 to make DB 600 aero engines for new Luftwaffe bomber- and fighter-aircraft. In the course of German re-armament and the Second World War the factory went on to make Daimler-Benz DB 601, DB 603 and DB 605 engines for various Luftwaffe aircraft. During the Second World War  the factory used at least 10,000 prisoners of war, forced labourers and concentration-camp prisoners to work in the factory. From 1943 to 1944 it used the forced labour of about 1,100 women prisoners from the Ravensbruck concentration camp north of Berlin. Ludwigsfelde lies at least 60 miles  from Ravensbruck, so the forced labourers were housed near the factory in a subsidiary concentration camp called the Deutschlandhalle. Early in 1945 the United States Army Air Forces bombed the factory. Then, after the surrender of Germany in May 1945, what remained of the works was dismantled and taken to the Soviet Union as part of the Allies' programme to take reparations from Germany and reduce German industrial capacity.",

Despite its picturesque geographical location in the so-called Steine Depression  between the Table Moun\u00adtains and the Stone Moun\u00adtains and its history reaching back to the 14th century, Mittelsteine was before the Second World War a highly industrialized village.  The hamlet was, for example, the site of a major power plant that supplied electricity to the electrified Silesian grid  of the German railway system  considered one of the most valuable assets of the Reich. It was a major railway junction already in the 19th century. Mittelsteine was thus a natural choice for the location of various industries. Today, the border crossing between the Czech Republic and Poland at Otovice\u2013Tlumaczow is just 8\u00bd\u00a0km or 5\u00a0miles away; while the nearest town in Germany, Zittau, is 179\u00a0km or 111 miles away.",

The civilians were captured in groups of unsuspecting passers-by or kidnapped from selected city quarters that had been surrounded in advance by German forces. Those caught in roundups were most often sent to slave labour in Germany, but some were also taken as hostages or executed in reprisal actions; imprisoned and sent to concentration camps or summarily executed in numerous ethnic-cleansing operations.",

        "Death and legacy On 30 April 1940 his staff quarters, in a ravine near the village of Anielin , were ambushed. In an unequal battle Dobrzanski and most of his men were killed. The Germans desecrated his body and put it on public view in the local villages. They then transported it to Tomaszow Mazowiecki and either burnt it or buried it in an unknown location. The remnants of the \"Separated Unit of the Polish Army\" continued the struggle until 25 June 1940, when it was disbanded. In 1949 Dobrzanski's son, Ludwik, emigrated to England and became a property developer. He died on 15 December 1990 in Bedford. In 1966 Henryk Dobrzanski was posthumously awarded the Golden Cross of the Virtuti Militari and promoted to Colonel. Currently almost 200 organisations and institutions bear his name, including 82 Scouting groups, 31 schools and several military units. There are streets named after him in almost every Polish city. The site of his burial remains unknown. In 1973 the film Hubal, based on his resistance campaign, was released. The pseudonym \"Hubal\" comes from his family coat of arms.",

        "Slovenia The Nazi persecution of the Church in annexed Slovenia was akin to that which occurred in Poland. Within six weeks of the Nazi occupation, only 100 of the 831 priests in the Diocese of Maribor and part of the Diocese of Ljubljana remained free. Clergy were persecuted and sent to concentration camps, religious Orders had their properties seized, some youth were sterilized. The first priest to die was Aloysius Zuzek. Following the German invasion of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in April 1941, Slovenia was partitioned, between Italy, Hungary and Germany, which annexed the north. In the Carinthian and Styrian regions, the mainly Austrian rulers commenced a brutal campaign to destroy the Slovene nation. The Jesuit John Le Farge reported in the Catholic press in the America that the situation an official report sent to the Vatican following the invasion \"may be briefly described as hell for Catholics and Catholicism in Slovenia, a 98% Catholic country, a hell deliberately planned by Adolf Hitler out of his diabolical hatred of Christ and His Church\". As in other occupied territories, the German army confiscated church property, dissolved religious houses and arrested and exiled priests.",

        "World War II In 1939 the Luftwaffe constructed an airfield near Konigsberg\u00a0, later used by the Soviet Air Forces between 1945 and 1992. A subcamp of the Ravensbruck concentration camp was set up for the enlargement of the airfield. After the Warsaw Uprising, many Polish women from Warsaw were imprisoned there. In January 1945 battles of the Vistula\u2013Oder Offensive occurred in and around the town. The German population fled in haste warned about the mass rapes. On 4 February 1945 Kurt Floter, Konigsberg's then mayor, was condemned to death by hanging by an SS court martial chaired by Otto Skorzeny, because he had fled before issuing a general evacuation order by the military. On the same day the Soviet Red Army occupied the town. The entire city centre with the Church of St. Mary and the town hall was burned to the ground by the Soviets on 16 February 1945. 80 percent of the entire town was destroyed. After the German capitulation, under border changes promulgated at the Potsdam Conference, the town became again part of Poland.",

However, due to Allied air raids on the railway hub and local factories and its position as a German bridgehead on the east bank of the Oder during the Battle of the Oder-Neisse and the Battle of the Seelow Heights, almost 95% of its buildings were destroyed  and the town was generally deserted. The town was captured by the Red Army on 11 March 1945. The suburb Alt-Drewitz  contained a Nazi POW camp, Stalag III-C Alt-Drewitz, used mostly for American, French, Soviet, and Italian prisoners of war.

Camp physician and SS-Untersturmfuhrer Hans Munch considered the facts of Auschwitz \"so firmly determined that one cannot have any doubt at all\", and described those who negate what happened at the camp as \"malevolent\" people who have \"personal interest to want to bury in silence things that cannot be buried in silence\". Zyklon B handler and SS-Oberscharfuhrer Josef Klehr said that anyone who maintains that nobody was gassed at Auschwitz must be \"crazy or in the wrong\". SS-Unterscharfuhrer Oswald Kaduk stated that he did not consider those who maintain such a thing as normal people. Hearing about Holocaust denial compelled former SS-Rottenfuhrer Oskar Groning to publicly speak about what he witnessed at Auschwitz, and denounce Holocaust deniers, stating:",

        "Treblinka song According to postwar testimonies, when transports were temporarily halted, then-deputy commandant Kurt Franz wrote lyrics to a song meant to celebrate the Treblinka extermination camp. In reality, prisoner Walter Hirsch wrote them for him. The melody came from something Franz remembered from Buchenwald. The music was upbeat, in the key of D major. The song was taught to Jews assigned to work in the Sonderkommando. They were forced to memorise it by nightfall of their first day at the camp. Unterscharfuhrer Franz Suchomel recalled the lyrics as follows: \"We know only the word of the Commander. / We know only obedience and duty. / We want to keep working, working, / until a bit of luck beckons us some time. Hurray!\" A musical ensemble was formed, under duress, by Artur Gold, a popular Jewish prewar composer from Warsaw. He arranged the theme to the Treblinka song for the 10-piece prisoner orchestra which he conducted. Gold arrived in Treblinka in 1942 and played music in the SS mess hall at the Wohnlager on German orders. He died during the uprising.",

        "Early history of the camp Island Farm Camp was originally built as a hostel for female workers employed at a munitions factory in Bridgend, but conditions at the hostel were so dreary that the women preferred to travel, as much as 30 miles , from their homes each day. The camp remained empty until 1943, when it was used to accommodate American troops who would subsequently be involved in the Allied invasion of France. After the invasion the authorities had to find suitable accommodation for large numbers of POWs captured in Europe. The prefabricated concrete huts surrounded by open fields at Island Farm were considered ideal, although the barracks had to be converted and barbed wire fences erected. This work had not been completed by the time the first batch of prisoners arrived, so the prisoners were put to work completing the conversion. Island Farm was designated as Camp 198 and was to hold almost 2,000 prisoners. The first POWs were a mixture of Italian and German troops, but the War Office soon decided that the camp was too comfortable for enlisted men and that German officers should be held there. The first officer prisoners arrived in November 1944.",

Conrad's unexpected arrival encouraged the warriors so much that they wished to attack the enemy immediately.\" The arrival of Conrad, the exiled Duke of Lotharingia , and Otto's son-in-law, was particularly heartening because he had recently thrown in his lot with the Magyars, but now returned to fight under Otto; in the ensuing battle he lost his life.

The Croatian extreme nationalists, Usta\u0161e, killed thousands , primarily Serbs, in the Jasenovac concentration camp. The 13th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Handschar , created in February 1943, and the 23rd Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Kama, created in January 1944, were manned by Croats and Bosniaks as well as local Germans. Earlier in the war, Pavelic formed a Croatian Legion for the Eastern front and attached it to the Wehrmacht. Volunteer pilots were also joining the Luftwaffe as Pavelic did not want to get his army directly involved for both propaganda reasons  and due to a safeguard need for political flexibility with the Soviet Union. Pavelic sought to eliminate an inferiority complex among the leadership as well as attempt to get favoritism from the Germans by proclaiming Croats as descendants from Goths. The \"Poglavnik\" also stated that \"Croats are not Slavs, but Germanic by blood and race\". Nazi German leadership was indifferent to this claim.",

        "After liberation Play media Footage from after liberation Authorities worked night and day to alleviate conditions at the camp immediately following the liberation as an epidemic of black typhus swept through the prisoner population. Two thousand cases had already been reported by 3 May. By October of the same year the camp was being used by the U.S. Army as a place of confinement for war criminals, the SS and important witnesses. It was also the site of the Dachau Trials for German war criminals, a site chosen for its symbolism. In 1948, the Bavarian government established housing for refugees on the site, and this remained for many years. Among those held in the Dachau internment camp set up under the U.S. Army were Elsa Ehrich, Maria Mandl, and Elisabeth Ruppert.",

        "Early career and wartime activities Born in Ebingen, Kingdom of Wurttemberg , Kiesinger studied law in Berlin and worked as a lawyer in Berlin from 1935 to 1940. As a student, he joined the  Roman Catholic corporations K.St.V. Alamannia Tubingen\u00a0 and Askania-Burgundia Berlin. He became a member of the Nazi Party in February 1933, but remained a largely inactive member. In 1940, he was called to arms but avoided mobilization by finding a job in the Foreign Office's broadcasting department, rising quickly to become deputy head of the department from 1943 to 1945 and the department's liaison with the Propaganda Ministry. After the war, he was interned and spent 18 months in the Ludwigsburg camp before being released as a case of mistaken identity. During the controversies of 1966, the magazine Der Spiegel unearthed a Memorandum dated 7 November 1944  in which two colleagues denounced to SS chief Heinrich Himmler a conspiracy including Kiesinger that was allegedly propagating defeatism. They accused Kiesinger specifically of hampering anti-Jewish actions within his department.",

A small number of men from these camps also joined the staff of the Ministry of Propaganda, working for radio stations and magazines.

On 18 August 1920 the town was the site of a Polish victory over the invading Soviets in the Battle of Brodnica\u00a0 during the Polish\u2013Soviet War. In the 1920s the town was visited by highest Polish dignitaries: Prime Minister Wincenty Witos, Marshal Jozef Pilsudski and President Stanislaw Wojciechowski. During the occupation of Poland , in 1939, Germans carried out mass arrests of local Poles, who were later murdered in the area or deported to Nazi concentration camps. Some of these Poles were murdered in Skrwilno between 15 October and 15 November 1939 and in Brzezinki in October 1939. The interwar principal of the local high school, Klemens Malicki, was among the Polish principals and teachers murdered in the Oranienburg concentration camp as part of the Intelligenzaktion Pommern. In 1944, the Germans also established a subcamp of the Stutthof concentration camp, intended for female prisoners. The German occupation ended in January 1945.",

        "Arson damage caused to this barrack building has been covered in glass to protect it, whilst still showing the damage to those visiting the camp The compound has been vandalized by Neo-Nazis several times. In September 1992, barracks 38 and 39 of the Jewish Museum were severely damaged in an arson attack. The perpetrators were arrested, and the barracks were reconstructed by 1997. However, it is important to note that the decision was taken that no buildings built during the Nazi regime will be rebuilt on the site. The destroyed section of the huts are now a Jewish museum with the surviving section left as it was immediately after the fire with the paint still blistered from the flames. Sites within Sachsenhausen and Dachau which had been approved for inclusion in the augmented reality smartphone game Ingress were removed in July 2015; Gabriele Hammerman, director of the memorial site at Dachau, told the Deutsche Presse-Agentur that Google's actions were a humiliation for victims and relatives of the Nazi camps, and Niantic Labs' founder John Hanke stated that \"we apologize that this has happened.\"",

        "In 1970 wide-ranging agreements were achieved between trades unions both on wage rate increase targets and on the need to return to traditional twelve month intervals between renegotiation.   However, this seems not to have been enough for many workers in the south-west of Germany, nor for the Stuttgart region leadership team of IG Metall around Willi Bleicher.   Several waves of spontaneous workplace stoppages during the Stuttgart negotiations raised the pressure on the employers. In the end a basic increase of 15% was agreed for the North Wurttemberg \u2013 North Baden region. It appeared that once again Bleicher had understood how to apply a successful progressive increase of pressure on the employer side, and so achieved a change of heart.   He achieved this, not least, through an intensive information campaign with its focus on the work force and on local trades union officials with regard to the decision process. As ever, he saw continuing provision of information at factory level as key to ensuring that the workforce were prepared to engage in industrial conflict.<ref name=WBlautRF04/>",

        "Ravensbruck In September/October 1942 Antonia briefly faced a tribunal before being returned to the jail in Vienna.   In October 1942 she was transferred to the Ravensbruck concentration camp in the damp flat countryside to the north of Berlin.   She was one of thirteen women from the Czech and Slovak resistance sent together from the Vienna area.   One of them was her friend Irma Trksak, sister to Franz Narkowitz who had been a member of the Lobau team .   The journey lasted around for weeks.   She was accompanied by a \"Ruckkehr Unerwunscht\"  instruction, which amounted to a death sentence.   Through the mediation of Hermi Jursa they remained together on arriving, accommodated in the \"Political Block\" in which Rosa Jochmann was \"Block senior\" .  Jochmann's leadership went some way to mitigate the horrors of concentration camp life and, above all, to encourage camp inmates to coordinate opposition to the SS personnel running the camp on behalf of the Nazi authorities.   Inmates were also encouraged to display practical solidarity with political detainees, the old and the weak.",

At the time the camps did not have their own gas chambers. The scale of prisoner transportation to Sonnenstein is still not fully known. Records show transportations from the concentration camps of Sachsenhausen, Buchenwald and Auschwitz. The mass gassing of almost 600 inmates from the Auschwitz concentration camp at the end of July 1941 marked the transition to a new dimension in war crime. In the first half of 1942 extermination camps for Polish and European Jews were established, especially in East Poland, under Operation Reinhard, that were able to draw on the experience gained under Action T4. About a third of the employees at the Sonnenstein Death Institute were deployed during 1942 and 1943 to the extermination camps of Belzec, Sobibor and Treblinka.",

        "Trial In the Einsatzgruppen trial, Sandberger was charged with crimes against humanity, war crimes, and membership in a criminal organization, that is, the SS.  At his trial, Sandberger denied responsibility for the killings described in the 15 October report and sought to blame the German field police and Estonian home guard. This was rejected by the tribunal, which found that the Estonian home guard was under Sandberger's jurisdiction and control for specific operations, as shown by the same report. Similarly, Sandberger claimed he had arrested the Jews sent to Pskov to protect them, hoping that during the internment the Fuhrer order might be revoked or meliorated and he was not in general responsible for their execution at the Pskov detention camp. Sandberger said he was responsible for \"only a fraction\" of the killings. Sandberger estimated this \"fraction\" at 300 to 350 persons.",

Two of these camps were the only Nazi concentration camps on British soil, the other two were labour camps.

Norderney camp housed European  and Russian enforced labourers. The prisoners in Lager Norderney and Lager Sylt were slave labourers. The Borkum and Helgoland camps were \"volunteer\"  labour camps and the labourers in those camps were treated harshly but better than the inmates at the Sylt and Norderney camps.

The German Guidance Office encompassed the camp at Sennheim, as well as the network of recruiting offices already established throughout occupied Europe, and became a separate department of the SS-HA, with separate sections for leadership, recruiting and education, and six regional sub-sections. After the Balkan Campaign of April 1941, the LSSAH was expanded to divisional strength, and following the commencement of the invasion of the Soviet Union, a sixth Waffen-SS division, SS-Division Nord was formed from four of the former \"SS-Totenkopf\" regiments, all of which had been re-designated \"SS Infantry\" regiments. These new divisions had an initial strength only two-thirds that of the original divisions. The Polizei-Division was also renamed the SS-Polizei-Division. The expectations on Berger's recruiting network continued to increase, just as casualties began to mount in earnest.",

A \"displaced persons camp\" is a temporary facility for displaced persons, whether refugees or internally displaced persons. Two years after the end of World War II in Europe, some 850,000 people lived in displaced persons camps across Europe, among them Armenians, Poles, Latvians, Lithuanians, Estonians, Yugoslavs, Jews, Greeks, Russians, Ukrainians, Hungarians and Czechoslovaks. At the end of the Second World War, at least 11 million people had been displaced from their home countries, with about seven million in Allied-occupied Germany. These included former prisoners of war, released slave laborers, and both non-Jewish and Jewish concentration-camp survivors. The Allies categorized the refugees as \u201cdisplaced persons\u201d  and assigned the responsibility for their care to the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration .",

The latter, in her \"The Jewish Communities of Fiume and the Carnaro\"  argued that, based on official records, the Germans and the RSI police conducted the arrests of the Jews through the lists of the Italian police. The arrests began in October 1943 and were organized first as round-ups and then as targeted operations in which the Italian Questura provided information to both locate and identify Fiume Jews. Both German and Italian records indicate that by June 1944 hardly any Jews had remained in Fiume. Moreover, if local records had been destroyed, something of which there is no sign, those refugees would still appear in the central police archive that kept copies of all local police headquarters as well as in the records of the Italian DP camps after the war, which is not the case.",

In a memorandum to Hitler dated 25 May 1940, \"A Few Thoughts on the Treatment of the Ethnically Alien Population in the East\", Himmler stated that it was in German interests to foster divisions between the ethnic groups in the East. He wanted to restrict non-Germans in the conquered territories to an elementary-school education that would teach them how to write their names, count up to 500, work hard, and obey Germans. The Polish political class became the target of a campaign of murder . Between 1.8 and 1.9\u00a0million non-Jewish Polish citizens were killed by Germans during the war; about four-fifths were ethnic Poles and the rest Ukrainians and Belarusians. At least 200,000 died in concentration camps, around 146,000 in Auschwitz. Others died in massacres or in uprisings such as the Warsaw Uprising, where 120,000\u2013200,000 were killed.",

After 1871 the city was part of Germany, within which it remained after the Treaty of Versailles of 1919. In 1939 it had 33,000 mostly German inhabitants. During World War II, the Germans established six forced labour camps in the city, a transit camp for Polish children intended for Germanisation, as well as a transit camp for Poles transported from the transit camp in Pruszkow near Warsaw after the suppression of the 1944 Warsaw Uprising. The town was made into a stronghold by the German government early in 1945 in the last stages of World War II. Glogau was besieged for six weeks by the Soviet Red Army, which left 98% of the buildings completely destroyed.",

        "Inmate help In July 1942, Diana Budisavljevic, with the help of a German officer, Albert von Kotzian, obtained written permission to take the children from the Stara Gradi\u0161ka concentration camp. With the help of the Ministry of Social Affairs, including Kamilo Bresler, she was able to relocate child inmates from the camp to Zagreb, and other places. The Red Cross has been accused of insufficiently aiding the persecuted people of Nazi Europe. The local representative, Julius Schmidllin, was contacted by the Jewish community, which sought financial aid. The organisation helped to release Jews from camps, and even debated with the Croatian government in relation to visiting the Jasenovac camp. The wish was eventually granted in July 1944. The camp was prepared for the arrival of the delegation, so nothing incriminating was found. Inmate resistance groups were aided by contacts among the Usta\u0161e. One of these groups, operating in the tannery, was assisted by an Usta\u0161e, Dr Marin Jurcev , who were later hanged for this on orders of Dinko \u0160akic, as was any Ustasha found guilty of consorting or collaborating with inmates were executed.",

The Jewish cemetery, where the Nazis removed all but one of the tombstones, stands on the side of the hill at the eastern end of the camp, near the Grey house. Amon Goth's villa remains there. Another small monument, located near the opposite end of the site, stands in memory of the first execution of  Polish prisoners in 1939. A version of the camp is featured in the movie Schindler's List , about the life of Oskar Schindler. As the Plaszow area is now a nature preserve, the director Steven Spielberg built a camp replica in the Liban Quarry, some hundred meters away. Each year, it is the finishing point of the March of Remembrance taking part in mid-March to manifest the respect to the victims of the Holocaust.",

        "Debate over number of victims The precise number of victims is disputed and will probably never be known with certainty. During the Purge itself official radio and newspaper reports only gave the names of 10 people killed: the six SA-leaders executed in Stadelheim Prison on June 30; Kurt von Schleicher, a German general and a former Chancellor of the Weimar Republic, and his wife; Karl Ernst, who was wrongly reported to have been shot in Stadelheim, whereas in fact he was shot in the barracks of Hitler's Personal Guard Unit in Berlin Lichterfelde; and Ernst Rohm. While the German newspapers avoided disclosing the names of further victims of the purge, in the weeks and months to follow, the international press would set out to detail a more comprehensive account of how many people had been killed between June 30 to July 2. They managed to present about 100 names of people allegedly killed, although a number of those eventually turned out to have survived, such as the former SA chief of Berlin Wolf-Heinrich Graf von Helldorf  and Adolf Morsbach, the head of the cosmopolitan-minded Akademischer Austauschdienst , who had instead been sent to a Nazi concentration camp.",

The timber fortress was sacked by Algirdas  in 1356 and fell in flames in 1387. The Novgorod Republic immediately rebuilt its fortifications in limestone 1.3 kilometers  downstream. In 1428, Grand Duke of Lithuania Vytautas destroyed the western wall by artillery fire and entered Porkhov. Two years later, the Novgorodians augmented the fortress and rebuilt its walls. After the fall of Novgorod to the Muscovites in 1478, the fortress lost its military importance. Porkhov was the second most important town of Shelon Pyatina, after Russa. It was not, however, a significant economical center\u2014there were only seventy-six homesteads there in the 15th century and almost all of them were peasant ones. During World War II, Porkhov was occupied by German troops from July\u00a011, 1941 to February\u00a026, 1944 and was a place of a concentration camp.",

Yet time has shown that conditions within concentration camps were harsh, dangerous and eventually, murderous. The Nuremberg laws were also introduced to stamp out any Jewish presence. Passed in 1935 at the annual party rally, the laws had two basic aims. Firstly the law for the protection of German blood and German honour was passed, which prohibited marriage and extra-marital intercourse between Jews and Germans. Secondly, the Reich Citizenship Law was also passed, which stripped Jews of their citizenship.  However, anti-Jewish prejudice and violence did not end here, with events radicalising during Kristallnacht on 10 November 1938. Finally, the passing of the Enabling Law would have been fairly impossible without the Malicious Practices Act. As the SA and SS had surrounded the representative buildings no elected officials were able to vote other than the Nazis and their supporters. As such the Act was passed with ease and consequently this gave Hitler complete dictatorial powers, hence beginning the radicalisation and implementation of total Nazi rule.",

This resulted in the Swedish information campaign entitled Levande Historia . Realizing that 'the fight against ignorance about the Holocaust called for an international partnership' Persson also approached US President Bill Clinton and UK Prime Minister Tony Blair for their support in establishing an international organization to support Holocaust education, remembrance, and research worldwide.",

        "Nazi Germany Regime change came in January 1933 and the new government lost little time in establishing one-party dictatorship in Germany.  A couple of weeks later, on 9 February 1933, Fritz Dressel made a speech in the Bavarian Landtag in which he was highly critical of the government's newly introduced labour service obligation .    Presciently, and using chilling language, he predicted that this was part of a step by step strategy to militarize the young people affected.   In April 1933 Dressel held a meeting with the local gauleiter, Adolf Wagner in order to protest about the terror being inflicted by the Nazi party's quasi-military wing, the so-called SA.   For Dressel the conversation had a personal aspect since his wife Dora had been taken into \"protective custody\" on 30 March 1933. Fritz Dressel himself was arrested by the Bavarian police on 3 May 1933 and taken to the concentration camp at Dachau.   His political career made Dressel a high-profile opponent of the regime and his detention was reported prominently in the \"Feldmochinger Zeitung\" .",

Throughout 1942 in North Africa, British Empire forces fought a desperate land campaign against the Germans and Italians to prevent the loss of Egypt and the vital Suez canal. Here, fighting in the harsh Libyan desert, Free French soldiers distinguished themselves. General Marie Pierre Koenig and his unit\u2014the 1st Free French Infantry Brigade\u2014resisted the Afrika Korps at the Battle of Bir Hakeim in June 1942, although they were eventually obliged to withdraw, as Allied forces retreated to El Alamein, their lowest ebb in the North African campaign. Koenig defended Bir Hakeim from 26 May to 11 June against superior German and Italian forces led by Generaloberst Erwin Rommel, proving that the FFF could be taken seriously by the Allies as a fighting force. British General Claude Auchinleck said on 12 June 1942, of the battle: \"The United Nations need to be filled with admiration and gratitude, in respect of these French troops and their brave General Koenig\". Even Hitler was impressed, announcing to the journalist Lutz Koch, recently returned from Bir Hakeim:",

        "Discrimination of Jews following the book German universities were hotbeds of volkisch activity in the early 20th century, and The Foundations was extremely popular on university campuses with many university clubs using The Foundations as a reason to exclude Jewish students from joining. Likewise, military schools were centers of volkisch thought in the early 20th century, and so The Foundations was very popular with officer cadets; though since neither the Navy nor the Prussian, Bavarian, Saxon and Wurttemberg armies accepted Jewish officer candidates, Die Grundlagen did not lead to Jews being excluded. The only exceptions to the otherwise total exclusion of German Jews from the officer corps were the Bavarian and Saxon armies, which were prepared to accept Jews as reserve officers. Liberal and Social Democratic newspapers gave the book extremely poor reviews with reviewers complaining of an irrational way of reasoning in The Foundations, noting that Chamberlain quoted the writings of Goethe out of context in order to give him views that he had not held, and that the entire book was full of an obsessive anti-Semitism which they found extremely off-putting.",

Frank's memorandum of 26 September 1942 to SS administrators at Lublin and Auschwitz directing that the Jewish Star be removed from the garments of deceased inmates. Frank appears to have planned to personally profit from concentration camp labor.  He was an incorporating partner with Georg Lorner, another WVHA official, in a leather and textile enterprise at Dachau.   Based on this and other evidence, the court rejected Frank's testimony as incredible:",

It is estimated that between 14,000 and 18,000 people, mostly Jews from Sarny and surrounding towns, including an estimated 100 Roma, were systematically executed in the ravines on the outskirts of the town, where pits had been prepared.  The executions were carried out by German troops and the Ukrainian Auxiliary Police, assisted by some 200 members of Organization Todt.  Some escaped the massacre by running into the nearby forests after some of the prisoners set fire to huts in the camp and urged people to flee.

Later, on February 13, 5,000 Jews were sent to Treblinka. During the deportations, many synagogues were looted and some people were murdered. The last Jews were deported in March, 1943. By the end of the war, only one Jew had remained in the ghetto. After the war, the Jewish community was revived. Most of the Jews emigrated after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Today there are several hundred Jews in the city with most of the community's activity centralized in the main synagogue that had been returned to the community by the authorities in the 1990s.

Cigarettes in the parcels became the preferred medium of exchange within the camp, with each individual cigarette valued at 27 cents within Stalag Luft I. Similar practices were followed in other POW camps, as well. Cigarettes were also used to bribe German guards to provide the prisoners with outside items that would otherwise have been unavailable to them. Tins of coffee, which were hard to come by in Germany late in the war, served this same purpose in many camps. Contents of these packages were sometimes pilfered by German guards or other camp personnel, especially toward the end of the war.",

The Yellow Star and ghettoization laws, and the deportations, were accomplished in less than eight weeks, with the enthusiastic help of the Hungarian authorities, particularly the gendarmerie . The plan was to use 45 cattle cars per train, four trains a day, to deport 12,000 Jews from the countryside every day, starting in mid-May; this was to be followed by the deportation of Jews from Budapest from about 15 July. Rudolf Hoss, the first commandant of Auschwitz, returned to the camp between 8 May and 29 July 1944 as the local SS garrison commander to oversee the Hungarian Jews' arrival and gassing.

        "Alliance with Germany As war approached in 1939, the Fascist regime stepped up an aggressive press campaign against France claiming that Italian people were suffering in France. This was important to the alliance as both regimes mutually had claims on France, Germany on German-populated Alsace-Lorraine and Italy on Italian-populated Corsica, Nizza and Savoia. In May 1939, a formal alliance was organized. The alliance was known as the Pact of Steel, which obliged Italy to fight alongside Germany if war broke out against Germany. Mussolini felt obliged to sign the pact in spite of his own concerns that Italy could not fight a war in the near future. This obligation grew from his promises to Italians that he would build an empire for them and from his personal desire to not allow Hitler to become the dominant leader in Europe. Mussolini was repulsed by the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact agreement where Germany and the Soviet Union agreed to partition the Second Polish Republic into German and Soviet zones for an impending invasion. The Fascist government saw this as a betrayal of the Anti-Comintern Pact, but decided to remain officially silent.",

        "Demographics The General Government was inhabited by 11.4\u00a0million people in December 1939. A year later the population increased to 12.1\u00a0million. In December 1940, 83.3% of the population were Poles, 11.2% Jews, 4.4% Ukrainians and Belarusians, 0.9% Germans, and 0.2% others. About 860,000 Poles and Jews were resettled into the General Government after they have been expelled from the territories 'annexed' by Nazi Germany. Offsetting this was the German genocidal campaign of liquidation of the Polish intelligentsia and other elements considered likely to resist. From 1941 disease and hunger also began to reduce the population. Poles were also deported in large numbers to work as forced labor in Germany: eventually about a million were deported, of whom many died in Germany. In 1940 the population was segregated into different groups. Each group had different rights, food rations, allowed strips in the cities, public transportation and restricted restaurants. They were divided from the most privileged, to the least.",

In the beginning of May 1945 he was taken prisoner in Austria by Americans and was held until 1948. He returned to his family in Braunschweig and resumed work as a cabinet maker. In April 1960 the Frankfurt prosecutor's office issued an arrest warrant which was executed in September after Klehr's whereabouts was determined. On 19 August 1965, the court convicted him of murder in at least 475 cases, assistance in the joint murder of at least 2730 cases, and sentenced him to life imprisonment with an additional 15 years. The witness Glowacki testified in court that Klehr killed the women who survived the massacre after the alleged uprising at the Budy female subcamp by phenol injection.

Sobibor was one of four extermination camps established as part of Operation Reinhard, the deadliest phase of the Holocaust. The extermination of Europe's Jews did not originate as a single top-down decision, but was rather a patchwork of decisions made regarding particular occupied areas. Following the invasion of Poland in September 1939, the Germans began implementing the Nisko Plan in which Jews were deported from ghettos across Europe to the forced labor camps which comprised the Lublin Reservation. Lublin District region was chosen in particular for its inhospitable conditions. The Nisko Plan was abandoned in 1940, but many forced labor camps continued operations in the area, including Trawniki, Lipowa 7, and Dorohucza.",

The Hofle Telegram was an encrypted message sent to Berlin on 31 December 1942 by Operation Reinhard deputy commander Hermann Hofle, detailing the number of Jews deported by DRB to each of the Operation Reinhard death camps up to that point. Discovered among declassified documents in Britain, it shows that by the official count of the German Transport Authority 713,555 Jews were sent to Treblinka in 1942. The number of deaths was probably higher, according to the Armia Krajowa communiques. On the basis of the telegram and additional undated German evidence for 1943 listing 67,308 people deported, historian Jacek Andrzej Mlynarczyk calculated that by the official DRB count, 780,863 people were brought by Deutsche Reichsbahn to Treblinka.",

Renamed as the Central Labour Camp in Potulice under the management of the Stalinist Ministry of Public Security, the camp managed workshops and farms with the total area of 1,174.60 ha. According to records of the MBP Department of Corrections, some 2,915 Germans died there before the end of 1949, mainly as a result of the typhus and dysentery epidemics.

        "Plot Night and Fog is a documentary that alternates between past and present, using both black-and-white and colour footage. The first part of Night and Fog shows remnants of Auschwitz while the narrator Michel Bouquet describes the rise of Nazi ideology. The film continues with comparisons of the life of the Schutzstaffel to the starving prisoners in the camps. Bouquet then shows the sadism inflicted upon the doomed inmates, including scientific and medical experiments, executions, and rape. The next section is shown completely in black-and-white, and depicts images of gas chambers and piles of bodies. The final topic of the film depicts the liberation of the country, the discovery of the horror of the camps, and the questioning of who was responsible for them.",

Stalin turned his attention to the Armia Krajowa  which was seen as an obstacle in Soviet goals of controlling Poland hence the NKVD set out to destroy them. The Poles were accused of having Germans spies in their ranks, trying to take control of the Polish units fighting along with the Red Army, and causing desertions. Home Army units which fought against the Germans in support of the Soviet advance had their officers and men arrested.

        "The site Between August 1945 and 1 March 1950, Buchenwald was the site of NKVD special camp Nr. 2, where the Soviet secret police imprisoned former Nazis and anti-communist dissidents. According to Soviet records, 28,455 people were detained, 7,113 of whom died. After the NKVD camp closed, much of the camp was razed, while signs were erected to provide a Soviet interpretation of the camp's legacy. The first monument to victims was erected by Buchenwald inmates days after the initial liberation. It was made of wood and only intended to be temporary. A second monument to commemorate the dead was erected in 1958 by the GDR government near the mass graves. Inside the camp, there is a stainless steel monument on the spot where first, temporary monument stood. Its surface is maintained at 37\u00a0\u00b0C , the temperature of human skin, all year round.  Today the Buchenwald camp site serves as a holocaust memorial. It has a museum with permanent exhibitions about the history of the camp. It is managed by Buchenwald and Mittelbau-Dora Memorials Foundation, which also looks after the camp memorial at Mittelbau-Dora.",

        "Biography Family Norman Finkelstein was born on December 8, 1953, in New York City, the son of Harry and Maryla Finkelstein, nee Husyt. Finkelstein's parents were Jewish. His mother grew up in Warsaw and survived the Warsaw Ghetto and the Majdanek concentration camp. His father was a survivor of both the Warsaw Ghetto and Auschwitz. After the war they met in a displaced persons camp in Linz, Austria, and then emigrated to the United States, where his father became a factory worker and his mother a homemaker and later a bookkeeper. Finkelstein's mother was an ardent pacifist. Both his parents died in 1995. Finkelstein has said that \"they saw the world through the prism of the Nazi Holocaust. They were eternally indebted to the Soviet Union , and so anyone who was anti-Soviet they were extremely harsh on\". They supported the Soviet Union's approval of the creation of the State of Israel, as enunciated by Andrei Andreyevich Gromyko, who said that Jews had earned the right to a state, but thought that Israel had sold its soul to the West and \"refused to have any truck with it\".",

        "Red Cross involvement with Theresienstadt ICRC attempts to send supplies In 1942, the ICRC confirmed the existence of a Jewish ghetto at Theresienstadt and discovered that it was possible to send medicines, emboldening them to try that strategy with other concentration camps. Soon after, Roland Marti, the ICRC delegate in Berlin, requested permission for a trial visit to Theresienstadt, expecting that it would be easier to get permission than for other camps, but his request was denied. The DRK claimed that there was sufficient food and supplies at Theresienstadt, and Red Cross parcels were therefore unnecessary. In May 1943, the ICRC received confirmation signed by the Jewish elder at Theresienstadt that some food parcels had reached it. The ICRC's efforts to send food parcels to concentration camps were hampered by the American Red Cross's refusal to lobby the Allies to allow an exemption in the blockade of Nazi Germany for food imports destined for concentration camps. In order to avoid the parcels being siphoned off by the SS, the ICRC was only allowed to send them to named recipients.",

        "Efforts to preserve the historical record During the war One of the earliest efforts to save historical record of the Holocaust occurred during the war, in France, where Drancy internment camp records were carefully preserved and turned over to the new National Office for Veterans and Victims of War; however, the bureau then held them in secret, refusing to release copies later, even to the Center of Contemporary Jewish Documentation . In 1943, Isaac Schneersohn, anticipating the need for a center to document and preserve the memory of the persecution for historical reasons and also support claims post-war, gathered together 40 representatives from Jewish organizations in Grenoble which was under Italian occupation at the time in order to form a centre de documentation.  Exposure meant the death penalty, and as a result little actually happened before liberation. Serious work began after the center moved to Paris in late 1944 and was renamed the CDJC.",

        "Career After the war, Schumann became a celebrated jazz guitarist. In 1950, he left Germany for Australia along with his family before returning  to Berlin in 1954. He played with Marlene Dietrich, Ella Fitzgerald, and Helmut Zacharias, among others, before founding his own Coco Schumann Quartet. Schumann's eventful and colorful life is a subject of and is celebrated in a German-language true-to-life color graphic novel by Caroline Gille and Niels Schroder. His autobiography, The Ghetto Swinger: A Berlin Jazz-Legend Remembers, was first published in 1997 and became a bestseller. In 2012 it was staged as a musical in Hamburg. His French girlfriend gave him his \"Coco\" nickname after she struggled with the pronunciation of \"Jakob\". In reflection to his years in a concentration camp, Schumman recalled: \"I am a musician who was imprisoned in concentration camps,\" Schumann said in later years, adding: \"Not a concentration camp prisoner who plays music\". Schumann, who had been filmed in Theresienstadt in 1944 as part of a German documentary, Theresienstadt,  was featured in a 2013 documentary called Refuge in Music, about the life of Jewish musicians, composers and artists under the Third Reich.",

        "Liberation As most of the camps of the Mittelbau system were completely evacuated, there were not many prisoners left to be liberated by the Allies. Only some small subcamps, mostly containing Italian POWs, were not evacuated. The SS also left several hundred sick prisoners at Dora and in the Boelcke-Kaserne. They were freed when US troops  reached Nordhausen on 11 April 1945. There were also around 1,300 dead prisoners at the barracks. War correspondents took pictures and made films of the dead and dying prisoners at Dora. Like the documentation of Nazi atrocities at Bergen-Belsen, these were published around the globe and became some of the best-known testimonies of Nazi crimes. Most of those inmates who survived the transports were freed in mid-April at Bergen-Belsen or at other camps. Some, however, remained prisoners until early May and were freed in Mecklenburg or Austria. In total, even conservative estimates put the number of people who did not survive being sent to Mittelbau-Dora at over 20,000. Thus, around one in three of those confined here did not survive.",

        "Lagerfuhrer  was a paramilitary title of the SS, specific to the Totenkopfverbande .  A Lagerfuhrer was the head SS officer assigned to a particular concentration camp, serving as the commander of the said camp. The term Lagerfuhrer was distinct and separate from the position of Kommandant.  Lagerfuhrers were typically employed in  camp complexes, where a main camp would be divided into one or more smaller camps.  The most recognizable example of this was the Auschwitz command and control system, in which a single Kommandant oversaw the activities of three subordinate Lagerfuhrers, each in charge of one of three main Auschwitz concentration camps. The title of Lagerfuhrer was typically not used to denote commanders of \"sub-camps\".  Sub-camps were considered satellite work areas of a single Concentration Camp, often overseen by a senior SS-NCO or a junior SS officer who in turn either answered to their own Lagerfuhrer or the Kommandant of the main camp.",

This essential part of the war, in the area of information, found a culmination of sorts in the publication by the Front on 9 November 1943 of Faux Soir, a spoof version of the Le Soir newspaper circulated under the noses of the occupation authorities. The FI was highly active in preventing large numbers of Belgian men being forced to leave the country to work as forced labour in Germany. These 40,000 of these so-called \"Refractaires\" were hidden by the FI's \"Organisation Socrates\". In February 1943, the FI sent the sociologist Victor Martin on a spying mission in Germany to search for reliable information about what happened to the Jews deported to Germany. He came back in May with the first reliable report on their fate, as well as with detailed information on the functioning of the Auschwitz concentration camp.",

        "The International Youth Meeting Center in Oswiecim/Auschwitz is an educational institution whose campus lies between the center of the Polish city of Oswiecim and the former German concentration camp of Auschwitz. More than one million persons, mostly Jewish and Polish, were murdered at Auschwitz during the Second World War . Proposed in 1971, the Center was opened in 1986 following years of planning, negotiations, and fundraising. It seeks to \"develop the understanding of National Socialism and its consequences, particularly among young Germans, through dialogue and encounter between people of different origins\", and is particularly engaged with Germans and Poles, Christians and Jews. In 2010, the Center hosted more than 17,000 overnight stays by youth groups participating in its programs. Many young Germans and Austrians have held year-long voluntary positions at the Center that satisfy their civilian service  responsibility. One of these, Robert Thalheim, wrote and directed the German-language dramatic film And Along Come Tourists  that features the Center and its activities. The Polish and German names for the Center are Miedzynarodowy Dom Spotkan Mlodziezy w Oswiecimiu and Internationale Jugendbegegnungsstatte in Oswiecim/Auschwitz, respectively; the two names are conjoined in the abbreviation MDSM/IJBS for the Center.",

        "History The name appears to be derived from the name \"Margit\" , Saint Margaret the patron of a local church. The first time it was used in a document was in 1216. In the 14th century, it became a feudal holding of the Hungarian landlord.  In 1376 king Louis I of Hungary gave to Marghita the right of organizing a fair and it developed in the next centuries as a market town. There were several peasant revolts against the feudal system affecting Marghita in 1467 and 1514. At the beginning of the 14th century, it became, together with the whole of Bihor county and Hungary, an Ottoman province.  In 1823, a great fire destroyed half of the buildings of Marghita. After the 1848 revolution, the local peasants were no longer serfs and manufacturing and industry began to develop. In 1944, after German occupation about 2,100 Jews of Marghita were sent to death, concentration and labor camps as part of the Holocaust, and about 450 from them survived. After 1947 with the Soviets imposing a Communist government in Romania, factories and land were nationalized. Over the course of the next few years, Marghita took part in the Romanian industrialization process.",

        "Interwar period Stolp was not directly affected by the fighting in the First World War. The trams did not operate during the war, returning to the streets in 1919. Demographic growth remained high, although development slowed, because the city became peripheral, the Kreis  being situated on post-war Germany's border with the Polish Corridor. Polish claims to Stolp and its neighbouring area were refused during the Treaty of Versailles negotiations. The city, having become the regional center of the eastern part of Eastern Pomerania, thrived, becoming known as Little Paris. A cultural highlight was an annual art exhibition. From 1926 the city became an active point of Nazi supporters, and the influence of NSDAP grew rapidly. The party with Hitler received 49.1% of the city's vote in the German federal election of March 1933, when however, the election campaign was marked by Nazi terror. During the Kristallnacht, the night of 9/10 November 1938, the local synagogue was burned down.",

Approximately 230,000 children were held prisoner, and used in forced labour and medical experiments. Japanese prisoner-of-war camps, many of which were used as labour camps, also had high death rates. The International Military Tribunal for the Far East found the death rate of Western prisoners was 27 per cent , seven times that of POWs under the Germans and Italians. While 37,583 prisoners from the UK, 28,500 from the Netherlands, and 14,473 from the United States were released after the surrender of Japan, the number of Chinese released was only 56. At least five million Chinese civilians from northern China and Manchukuo were enslaved between 1935 and 1941 by the East Asia Development Board, or K\u014dain, for work in mines and war industries. After 1942, the number reached 10\u00a0million. In Java, between 4\u00a0and 10\u00a0million r\u014dmusha , were forced to work by the Japanese military.

        "Client and occupied states British Client states Egypt Main article: Military history of Egypt during World War II The United Kingdom controlled Egypt and used it as a major base for Allied operations throughout the region, especially the battles in North Africa against Italy and Germany. Its highest priorities were control of the Eastern Mediterranean, and especially keeping the Suez Canal open for merchant ships and for military connections with India and Australia. The Kingdom of Egypt was nominally an independent state since 1922 but effectively remained in the British sphere of influence with the British Mediterranean fleet being stationed in Alexandria and British Army forces being stationed in the Suez Canal zone. Egypt faced an Axis campaign led by Italian and German forces during the war. British frustration over King Farouk's reign over Egypt resulted in the Abdeen Palace Incident of 1942 where British Army forces surrounded the royal Abdeen Palace and demanded a new government be established, nearly forcing the abdication of Farouk until he submitted to British demands. The Kingdom of Egypt joined the United Nations on 24 February 1945. India",

        "Subcamps Further information: List of subcamps of Auschwitz Several other German industrial enterprises, such as Krupp and Siemens-Schuckert, built factories with their own subcamps. There were around 28 camps near industrial plants, each camp holding hundreds or thousands of prisoners. Designated as Aussenlager , Nebenlager , Arbeitslager , or Aussenkommando , camps were built at Blechhammer, Jawiszowice, Jaworzno, Lagisze, Myslowice, Trzebinia, and as far afield as the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia in Czechoslovakia. Industries with satellite camps included coal mines, foundries and other metal works, and chemical plants. Prisoners were also made to work in forestry and farming. For example, Wirtschaftshof Budy, in the Polish village of Budy near Brzeszcze, was a farming subcamp where prisoners worked 12-hour days in the fields. Their duties involved tending animals, and making compost by mixing human ashes from the crematoria with sod and manure. Incidents of sabotage to decrease production took place in several subcamps, including Charlottengrube, Gleiwitz II, and Rajsko. Living conditions in some of the camps were so poor that they were regarded as punishment subcamps.",

        "Aftermath At least 30,000 inmates died in Sachsenhausen from causes such as exhaustion, disease, malnutrition and pneumonia, as a result of the poor living conditions. Many were executed or died as the result of brutal medical experimentation. Over the course of its operation, over 100 Dutch resistance fighters were executed at Sachsenhausen. Dutch Freemasons were also sent to the camp including the Grand Master of the Grand Orient of the Netherlands, Hermannus Van Torgeren, who died there in March 1940, after being arrested by Klaus Barbie. The Dutch subsequently sought the extradition from Czechoslovakia of Antonin Zapotocky, who became President of Czechoslovakia, for his alleged role in the murder of Dutch prisoners during his time as a kapo at the camp. According to an article published on 13 December 2001 in The New York Times, \"In the early years of the war the SS practiced methods of mass killing there that were later used in the Nazi death camps. Of the roughly 30,000 wartime victims at Sachsenhausen, most were Russian prisoners of war\".",

        "Casualties and material losses German  Germans wounded at Narvik being repatriated to Germany on board the hospital ship Wilhelm Gustloff The official German casualties for the Norwegian Campaign totalled 5,296. Of these 1,317 were killed on land, while 2,375 were lost at sea. 1,604 were listed as wounded. The German losses at sea were heavy, with the sinking of one of the Kriegsmarine's two heavy cruisers, two of its six light cruisers, 10 of its 20 destroyers and six U-boats. With several more ships severely damaged, the German surface fleet had only three cruisers and four destroyers operational in the aftermath of the Norwegian Campaign. Two torpedo boats and 15 light naval units were also lost during the campaign. Two German battleships and two cruisers were damaged during the campaign. Official German sources give the number of German aircraft lost during the Norwegian Campaign as 90, with other estimates by historian Francois Kersaudy ranging as high as 240. In transport ships and merchant vessels, the Germans lost 21 ships at 111,700 tons, around 10% of what they had available at the time.",

        "Witold Pilecki Witold's Report, also known as Pilecki's Report, is a report about the Auschwitz concentration camp written in 1943 by Witold Pilecki, a Polish military officer and agent of the Polish resistance. Pilecki volunteered in 1940 to be imprisoned in Auschwitz to organize a resistance movement and send out information about it. His was the first comprehensive record of a Holocaust death camp to be obtained by the Allies. He escaped from the camp in April 1943. The report includes details about the gas chambers, \"Selektion\" and the sterilization experiments. It states that there were three crematoria in Auschwitz II able to cremate 8000 people daily. Pilecki's Report preceded and complemented the Auschwitz Protocols, compiled from late 1943, which warned about the mass murder and other atrocities taking place inside the camp. The latter consists of the Polish Major's Report by Jerzy Tabeau, who escaped with Roman Cieliczko on 19 November 1943 and compiled a report between December 1943 and January 1944; the Vrba-Wetzler report; and the Rosin-Mordowicz report.",

While exact numbers are not known, it is estimated that up to 600,000 Hungarians were captured altogether, including an estimated 200,000 civilians. An estimated 200,000 citizens perished. It was part of a larger system of the usage of foreign forced labor in the Soviet Union. In addition, an uncertain number of Hungarians were deported from Transylvania to the Soviet Union in the context of the Romania-Hungary Transylvanian dispute. In 1944, many Hungarians were accused by Romanians of being \"partisans\" and transferred to the Soviet administration. In early 1945, during the \"degermanization\" campaign all Hungarians with German names were transferred to the Soviets in accordance with the Soviet Order 7161.",

Several scenes of atrocities conducted by Germany were duly updated with commemorative plaques clearly indicating the nationality of the perpetrators. The IPN also requested better documentation and commemoration of crimes that had been perpetrated by the Soviet Union. The Polish government also asked UNESCO to officially change the name \"Auschwitz Concentration Camp\" to \"Former Nazi German Concentration Camp Auschwitz-Birkenau\", to clarify that the camp had been built and operated by Nazi Germany. At its 28 June 2007 meeting in Christchurch, New Zealand, UNESCO's World Heritage Committee changed the camp's name to \"Auschwitz Birkenau German Nazi Concentration and Extermination Camp .\" Previously some German media, including Der Spiegel, had called the camp \"Polish\".",

        "Leadership  The 1941 SS tour of the Mauthausen concentration camp headed by Heinrich Himmler . Taking part were Otto Kumm , Wilhelm Bittrich, and Paul Hausser, who became key figures in HIAG after the war. By December 1951, former high-ranking Waffen-SS general Paul Hausser was HIAG's first spokesperson. Two well-known former Waffen-SS commanders, Felix Steiner and Herbert Gille, became early leading figures. Sepp Dietrich and Kurt Meyer became active members upon their release from prison, in 1955 and 1954. Meyer became HIAG's most effective spokesman. After his death in 1961, Erich Eberhardt, formerly of SS Division Totenkopf, assumed that role. As of 1977, Wilhelm Bittrich served as the chairman; as of 1976 Hubert Meyer acted as the federal spokesperson. HIAG membership was open to convicted war criminals, with the group's position being to absolve them of their responsibility. For example, the group openly embraced and advocated on behalf of Dietrich, Walter Reder, and Herbert Kappler, the former SS men convicted of war-time massacres.",
